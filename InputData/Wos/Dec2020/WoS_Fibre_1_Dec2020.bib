Abstract = {{A 55-year-old man complained of sudden onset of severe neck pain. This
   was followed by prompt loss of consciousness and death. Autopsy revealed
   rupture of a saccular aneurysm, which was considered to have resulted
   from enlargement of the remaining ductal tissue, and was located on the
   medial aspect of the uppermost portion of the descending aorta. Dense
   blood extravasation was noted in the posterior mediastinum and extending
   to the strap muscles of the neck and larynx. Histological examination of
   the rupture site revealed disappearance of the medial elastic fibers and
   thickened intima covered with dense fibrous tissue. Spontaneous ductus
   arteriosus aneurysm in adults is a rare finding, but widespread use of
   imaging technologies has revealed that it develops more frequently than
   previously recognized. Fatal complications may occur even when the
   aneurysm is relatively small. Therefore, pathologists should be aware of
   this aneurysm as a potential cause of sudden death.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of conventional polarized light microscopy (PLM) methods
   for analyzing synthetic fiber evidence analyses is improved.
   Historically, using PLM for fiber identification relied on measuring
   refractive index. This prior PLM technology is reliable, but it is not
   efficient. Most fibers are optically anisotropic, having two principal
   refractive index values, N-(High) and N-(Low). When the fiber is mounted
   in intermediate refractive index medium, efficiency is improved by
   observing the change in contrast while the polarized light's vector is
   rotated relative to the fiber's axis. Minimum contrast occurs when the
   refractive indices of the mounting medium and fiber are equal. This
   angle of equality is determined by orienting the fiber's highest
   refractive index parallel to the polarized light's electric field
   vector, rotating the fiber or polarizing element, observing minimum
   contrast and measuring the angle of equality. This method is rapid,
   reduces remounting fibers in different mounting media and provides a
   quantitative measure for fiber comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{Cannabis sativa L. is a plant cultivated worldwide as a source of fiber,
   medicine and intoxicant. Traditionally, is divided into two main types:
   fiber type (hemp) and drug type (marijuana). Marijuana differs from hemp
   by the presence of a high quantity of the psychoactive drug, Delta
   9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The development of a validated method using
   short tandem repeats (STRs) could serve as an intelligence tool to link
   cases by means of genetic individualization or association of cannabis
   samples. For this purpose, a 13-locus STR multiplex method was
   developed, optimized, and validated by the Department of Forensic
   Science at Sam Houston State University (SHSU) according to relevant
   ISFG and SWGDAM guidelines. The European community considers C. sativa
   plants illegals, even though its consumption is accepted in precise and
   limited places (coffee shops or cannabis clubs in Netherlands and
   Spain). However, there are different gaps in the legislation of some
   European countries. For instance, in Italy, ``weed{''} possession is
   decriminalized. Although trafficking and sale are prohibited, possession
   of small quantities of marijuana is considered only a civil offense. In
   order to proceed with the kit evaluation and inter-laboratory
   comparison, SHSU DNA laboratory sent blind cannabis DNA samples of known
   genotypes. Blind DNA samples were analyzed in different laboratories
   with different sequencers and analysis conditions. In this article, the
   goals were: a) to demonstrate that 13-locus STR kit for C. sativa is
   robust enough and reproducible, in all forensic laboratories, and b) to
   show the applicability of the STR system in association with Cannabis
   saliva cases for intelligence purposes to link multiple cases by means
   of genetic individualization or association of cannabis samples.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The current clinical and forensic toxicological analysis of body fluids
   requires a modern approach to sample preparation characterized by high
   selectivity and enrichment capability, suitability for micro-samples,
   simplicity and speed, and the possibility of automation and
   miniaturization, as well as the use of small amounts of reagents,
   especially toxic solvents. Most of the abovementioned features may be
   realized using so-called microextraction techniques which cover
   liquid-phase techniques (e.g., single-drop microextraction, SDME;
   dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction, DLLME; hollow-fiber
   liquid-phase microextraction, HF-LPME) and solid-phase extraction
   techniques (solid-phase microextraction, SPME; microextraction in packed
   syringes, MEPS; disposable pipette tip extraction, DPX; stir bar
   sorption extraction, SBSE). Some other extraction methodologies like
   dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) or magnetic solid-phase
   extraction (MSPE) can also be easily miniaturized. This review briefly
   describes and characterizes the abovementioned extraction methods, and
   then presents their current applications to the preparation of body
   fluids analyzed for bioactive compounds in combination with appropriate
   analytical methods, mainly chromatographic and related techniques. The

Abstract = {{The body of a 43-year-old African woman with a history of aortic
   aneurysm and hypertension was forensically investigated after her sudden
   death. The cause of death was related to a cardiac tamponade due to a
   ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta. Post-mortem gross examination
   showed an abnormal whitish discoloration of the intima with fibrous
   thickening of the aortic wall. Several arteries (left main and
   circumflex coronaries, carotid, renal and iliac arteries) showed similar
   features. Upon histological examination, the aortic aneurysm as well as
   the other arteries sampled showed mucoid degeneration, excess
   mucopolysaccharides and pools of mucin inside the intima and the media
   associated with collagen and elastic fiber destruction and loss of
   smooth muscle cells. This pattern strongly suggested the diagnosis of
   intimomedial mucoid degeneration (IMMD), a rare arterial disorder
   consisting of a progressive deposition of mucin into the intima and
   media, with a strong prevalence in middle-aged black African females
   with high blood pressure. In addition to the typical features of IMMD,
   histological examination of the ascending aorta showed a thickening of
   the adventita with sparse mixed inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis,
   suggesting an additional chronic infectious aortitis. No infectious
   agent was detected. The body of literature on IMMD is reviewed and the
   origin of death is discussed in this case report.}},

   (SERS) using a conventional-microwave silver nanoparticles synthesis}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For many forensic traces (inks, fibres, paints, ...) the chemical
   characterization of dyes or pigments is currently performed with
   reliable techniques that nonetheless show a few drawbacks (extraction,
   interfering signals, fluorescence). The forensic community could benefit
   from a less labor intensive method that provides high sensitivity to
   detect trace amounts of dyes ( < 5\% weight) without matrix
   interference. Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is rapidly
   gaining interest in the forensic community for these particular reasons
   and is often cited as a technique of choice for dyes analysis. It
   remains however a specialized technique limited to well equipped
   laboratories for which substrates synthesis represent the largest
   constraint. In order to popularize its use, we present a simple
   synthesis of SERS substrates (less than 2 min heating time) using a
   conventional microwave furnace. The technique is fast, inexpensive and
   yields plasmonic silver nanoparticles suitable for many SERS
   applications. We optimize the heating time and microwave power (watts),
   and verify the plasmonic resonance using UV-Visible spectroscopy. The
   produced colloids possess a mean diameter of 35-40 nm, ideal for SERS
   experiments with a laser excitation in the blue-green, and are stable
   for months. We demonstrate the suitability of these colloids with the
   analysis of 11 dyes from different chemical categories, analyzed by both
   standard Raman and SERS. We infer the interaction mechanism between the
   dyes and the substrate as well as the contribution from molecular,
   surface plasmon, and charge transfer resonances. These results open up
   new possibilities for trace analysis of dyes and might contribute to
   promote its use in forensic and chemistry laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, more than 50 approved cultivars of fiber hemp (Cannabis
   sativa L.) are in agricultural production. Their content of psychoactive
   tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is legally restricted to <0.2\% (\%w/w in the
   dry, mature inflorescences). Cannabis strains with much higher THC
   contents are also grown, illegally or under license for drug production.
   Differentiation between these two groups relies on biochemical
   quantification of cannabinoid contents in mature floral material. For
   nonflowering material or tissue devoid of cannabinoids, the genetic
   prediction of the chemical phenotype (chemotype) provides a suitable
   method of distinction. Three discrete chemotypes, depending on the ratio
   of THC and the noneuphoric cannabidiol (CBD), can be distinguished: a
   ``THC-predominant{''} type, a ``CBD-predominant{''} type, and an
   intermediate chemotype. We present a systematic genetic prediction of
   chemotypes of 62 agricultural hemp cultivars grown in Europe. The survey
   reveals the presence of up to 35\% B-T allele-carrying individuals
   (representing either a THC-predominant or an intermediate chemotype) in
   some cultivars-which is unexpected considering the legal THC limit of
   0.2\% THC. The fact that 100\% of the seized drug-type seeds in this
   study revealed at least one B-T allele, reflects that plant breeding
   efforts have resulted in a fixation of the B-T allele in recreational
   Cannabis. To guarantee a sincere forensic application based on a genetic
   chemotype prediction, we recommend not to classify material of unknown
   origin if the samples size is below nine genetically independent
   individuals.}},

Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated to high mortality rate
   worldwide. However, the diagnosis of PE often results inaccurate. Many
   cases of PE are incorrectly diagnosed or missed and they are often
   associated to sudden unexpected death (SUD). In forensic practice, it is
   important to establish the time of thrombus formation in order to
   determine the precise moment of death. The autopsy remains the gold
   standard method for the identification of death cause allowing the
   determination of discrepancies between clinical and autopsy diagnoses.
   The aim of our study was to verify the morphological and histological
   criteria of fatal cases of PE and evaluate the dating of thrombus
   formation considering 5 ranges of time. Methods Pulmonary vessels
   sections were collected from January 2010 to December 2017. Sections of
   thrombus sampling were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The content
   of infiltrated cells, fibroblasts and collagen fibers were scored using
   a semi-quantitative three-point scale of range values. Results The 30
   autopsies included 19 males (63.3\%) and 11 females (36.7\%) with an
   average age of 64.5 +/- 12.3 years. The time intervals were as follows:
   early (<= 1 h), recent (> 1 h to 24 h), recent-medium (> 24 h to 48 h),
   medium (> 48 h to 72 h) and old (> 72 h). In the first hour, we
   histologically observed the presence of platelet aggregation by
   immunofluorescence method for factor VIII and fibrinogen. The presence
   of lymphocytes has been identified from recent thrombus (> 1 h to 24 h)
   and the fibroblast cells were peripherally located in vascular tissue
   between 48 and 72 h, whereas they resulted central and copious after 72
   h. Conclusions After a macroscopic observation and a good sampling
   traditional histology, it is important to identify the time of thrombus
   formation. We identified histologically a range of time in the
   physiopathology of the thrombus (early, recent, recent-medium, medium,
   old), allowing to determine the dating of thrombus formation and the
   exact time of death.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic markers can be used in seeds and in plants to distinguish
   drug-type from fiber-type Cannabis Sativa L. varieties even at early
   stages, including pre-germination when cannabinoids are not accumulated
   yet. With this aim, this paper reports sequencing results for
   tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCAS) and cannabidiolic acid
   synthase (CBDAS) genes from 21 C. sativa L. varieties. Taking into
   account that THCAS- and CBDAS-derived enzymes compete for the same
   substrate, the novelty of this work relies in the identification of
   markers based on both THCAS and CBDAS rather than THCAS alone. Notably,
   in our panel, we achieved an adequate degree of discrimination (AUC
   100\%) between drug-type and fiber-type cannabis samples. Our sequencing
   approach allowed identifying multiple genetic markers (single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms-SNPs-and a deletion/insertion) that effectively
   discriminate between the two subgroups of cannabis, namely fiber type
   vs. drug type. We identified four functional SNPs that are likely to
   induce decreased THCAS activity in the fiber-type cannabis plants. We
   also report the finding on a deletion in the CBDAS gene sequence that
   produces a truncated protein, possibly resulting in loss of function of
   the enzyme in the drug-type varieties. Chemical analyses for the actual
   concentration of cannabinoids confirmed the identification of drug-type
   rather than fiber-type genotypes. Genetic markers permit an early
   identification process for forensic applications while simplifying the
   procedures related to detection of therapeutic or industrial hemp.}},

Title = {{Reflective spectroscopy investigations of clothing items to support law
   enforcement, search and rescue, and war crime investigations}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{304}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Clothing articles are important pieces of evidence in criminal, search
   and rescue, and search and recovery investigations. Hyperspectral remote
   sensing of clothing will be an important tool for supporting such
   investigations in the near future. This study investigated over 300
   items of clothing that varied in fabric type, texture, color, and
   pattern. Clothing items were analyzed using an ASD FieldSpec 4 High
   Resolution spectroradiometer with a contact probe attachment. Of the
   clothing items analyzed, there were 141 having endmember fabrics (100\%
   single fabric type composition): 89 were cotton, 39 were polyester, 5
   were wool, 1 was cashmere, 3 were acrylic, 1 was leather, and 3 were
   rayon. The remaining 164 clothing items were various fabric blends.
   Spectral features relating to different fabric types exhibit sufficient
   differences that allow them to be discriminated from the surrounding
   environment, as well as from one another in many, but not all, cases.
   Cotton and polyester, in particular, two of the most widely-used
   fabrics, exhibit numerous features in the near infrared (NIR) and
   shortwave infrared (SWIR) that would allow them to easily be
   distinguished from geologic materials in the environment such as rocks
   and soil. Plant based fibers, especially cotton, possess similar
   reflectance features to vegetation owing to their cellulose content.
   Outdoor aging experiments were conducted for 19 weeks on selected
   fabrics. Although significant changes were observed in aged garments,
   the variability observed in the reflectance of the aged garments does
   not support the derivation of a metric for aging, at least over the
   relatively short time scale of this effort. Results from this study
   should support numerous forensic efforts globally for non-destructive
   investigation of clothing items in the field and in lab settings with a
   spectroradiometer, enhance the potential for remote sensing searches,
   and in the future, potentially documenting crime scenes with
   hyperspectral imaging. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{643-653}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In criminal activities, soil can be transferred from a crime scene to
   items linked with a perpetrator; for example, shoes, cars or tools.
   Several parameters will influence the quantity of soil transferred in a
   given scenario. The knowledge of the most influential factors can help
   the expert to assess the evidence using a logical approach at the
   activity level or to predict the amount of soil that can be expected in
   a given scenario. The influence of five chosen parameters, namely the
   shoe profile, shoe size, walker's weight, soil type and soil humidity
   were assessed using Design of Experiment (DOE) in order to understand
   their influence on soil quantity transferred on shoes.
   The Faced Central Composite Design (FCCD) using a quadratic model was
   found to be highly significant, thus they could be adequately used to
   model and to interpret the amount of soil recovered from one shoe.
   These designs demonstrate that the characteristics of the donor (soil
   type and soil humidity), as well as a combination of these two factors
   have a very significant impact on the soil transfer. The characteristics
   of the receptor (shoe profile, shoe size and walker's weight) also have
   an impact on the transfer but to a lesser extent.
   Globally, this research provides valuable information for the forensic
   scientist both in investigative mode: evaluation of the soil quantity
   possibly transferred on shoes, and in the evaluative steps: is the
   quantity of soil found on the suspect shoes in accordance to the
   proposition/scenario given by the prosecution and the defence?}},

Abstract = {{In the case of suspicious deaths, the technique of 1:1 taping is often
   used in Belgium. It consists of affixing a large number of adhesive
   tapes to the body of the victim. It is conventionally aimed at obtaining
   microtraces (e.g., fibers, hair) and is usually not used for DNA
   analysis. However, in some cases, DNA analysis of certain areas of
   interest identified on the 1:1 taping material can offer a last resort
   solution. The four-step method that is described in this article
   involves the selection of areas of interest on the body (Step 1), the
   selection of the corresponding tapes (Step 2), the decontamination of
   the tapes (Step 3), the selection of areas of interest on the tapes, for
   DNA sampling (Step 4). The method is illustrated by its successful
   application in four murder cases. In each case, DNA profiles of good
   quality could be identified, including profiles of persons different

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{27}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hair has become an invaluable resource in forensic, clinical, and
   bioarchaeological research. The unique interaction between the growing
   hair fiber, the hair follicle, and the endocrine system inundates the
   growing hair fiber with an incremental record of many of the discreet
   physiological processes of the body. A novel study by Webb a al. (2010)
   demonstrated that endogenous records of cortisol, the ``stress
   hormone{''}, are capable of being extracted from archaeological human
   hair through a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
   technique, thus providing insight into the ``invisible{''} stress
   experiences of an individual that would otherwise not be detectable
   through skeletal analysis. This study seeks to apply this technique to
   archaeological hair from 10 individuals from the Kellis 2 cemetery,
   Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt to evaluate patterns of cortisol production and to
   determine whether endogenous patterns of secretion are detectable for
   the steroid reproductive hormones estradiol and testosterone. All three
   hormones were identified in each individual within the sample, and
   analyses revealed that preservation was favorable. Incremental
   patterning of each hormone appears to reflect endogenous hormone
   secretion in life. Values for cortisol, estradiol in pre-menopausal
   females, and testosterone extracted from samples fall within reference
   values taken from archaeological and clinical research, though estradiol
   values for males and postmenopausal females exceeded projected reference
   values. The results of this study demonstrate that steroid reproductive
   hormones can be preserved in archaeological human hair, and that these
   hormones can be analyzed to create additional lines of inquiry into
   bioarcheological studies of ancient health and fertility.}},

Abstract = {{The current analytical techniques for characterizing printing and

   the amount of data that can be obtained from an individual sample and

   interrogate both sides of a sheeted material and provide measurements
   which are suitable for statistical interpretations. This offers analysts
   the ability to quickly discriminate between sheeted materials based on

   demonstrate how contactless resonant cavity dielectric spectroscopy may
   be used to differentiate between paper analytes of varying fiber species

Title = {{Evaluation of commercial forensic DNA extraction kits for
   decontamination and extraction of DNA from biological samples
   contaminated with radionuclides}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{302}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In preparing to respond to security incidents involving radioactive
   material, States should consider how they might address the unique
   challenge of analysing forensic evidence contaminated with these
   materials. In the case of DNA evidence, previous research has suggested
   that commercial forensic DNA extraction kits may be able to remove
   radioactive contamination from biological samples. If viable, this would
   allow the extraction and decontamination of biological samples to be
   undertaken in a laboratory equipped to handle radioactive material, with
   the subsequent quantification and profiling of extracted DNA performed
   in a conventional forensics laboratory. In order to inform the
   development of an operational capability, this study sought to expand
   upon previous work to provide a more comprehensive quantitative
   assessment of the efficacy of commercial DNA extraction kits for the
   removal of radionuclide contamination from biological samples and the
   quality of the resultant DNA profiles. Three commercial DNA extraction
   kits were tested for their ability to remove contaminating
   radionuclides. Two of these kits proved more effective at removing
   radionuclide contamination and produced DNA extracts of higher quality.
   Under all conditions tested in this study, decontamination efficiency
   was sufficient to allow the release of samples to a forensic laboratory.
   However, consistent with a prudent approach to radiation safety it is
   recommended that all samples be screened by gamma spectrometry prior to
   their release to a forensic laboratory in order to verify
   decontamination. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{As microplastic pollution evolved to a well-established research field,
   microplastic scientists started to explore new avenues in the field.
   Yet, while a multitude of different types of microplastics (microbeads,
   fibres, fragments) have been well-documented in microplastic literature,
   our analysis of this literature shows that glitter particles have been
   overlooked by the field. However, due to the presence of glitter-based
   research in forensic science, we explore the idea that glitter may have
   the potential to act as ``flag items{''} - or markers - of a likely
   source, due to the often complex and individual composition of glitter
   particles compared to traditional microplastics, such as microbeads. As
   such, this article demonstrates glitter has insofar been overlooked as a
   microplastic particle, and demonstrates that glitter may have an
   important role in explaining microplastic pollution dynamics from source
   to sink.}},

Abstract = {{The retention of gauze within the mediastinum is considered an
   exceptional finding. We are presenting the case of a woman, affected by
   aorto-mitral valvulopathy, in whose mediastinum was found, during the
   autopsy, a gauzome without signs of active phlogosis, which had been
   ``forgotten{''} in a previous surgery, acted 14 years before the death.
   A 39 y.o. woman had received surgical treatment of double aorto-mitral
   valve substitution and tricuspid plastic. At age 53, she successfully
   received surgery once again at a different hospital; she then started
   rehabilitation therapy, during which she deceased due to sudden
   hematemesis with infectious multi organ failure. During the autopsy, a 5
   cm long surgical gauze was found in the mediastinum. A SEM/EDX (Scanning
   Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) exam was
   ran on the foreign body and a sample of the same gauze used in the
   cardiac-surgical department of the hospital the victim had passed away
   in, to act a comparison between the two kinds of material. The exam
   showed a morphological difference between exogenous fibers incorporated
   within the gauzome and the control gauze.
   This case highlights the diagnostic and interpretative challenges in
   finding a foreign body within the mediastinum without signs of active
   phlogosis. SEM/EDX investigations executed on the gauzome and a
   ``control gauze{''} allowed the attribution of malpractice to the first
   hospital the victim had been operated in 14 years before the exitus. The
   SEM/EDX exam confirms its importance in correctly identifying the case,
   which becomes an example for similar happenings.}},

Abstract = {{It is a known fact that when fabric is left exposed to sunlight
   photodegradation occurs. However, no study has ever looked at the
   photodegradation that occurs to individual fibre filaments as commonly
   recovered from a scene of crime. To look at photodegradation of
   individual fibres, wool and cotton fabric were dyed using CI Acid Red 27
   and CI Direct Red 80 respectively at two depths of shade, 0.25\% and
   2.0\% owf. Pieces of fabric and individual fibre samples were then
   placed in a Light Fastness Q-Sun 1000 Xenon test chamber which simulated
   exposure to sunlight over two time periods, 64 h (equivalent to one
   weeks sun exposure) and 128 hrs (equivalent to two weeks sun exposure).
   The resulting pieces of fabric and fibres where then examined using high
   power comparison microscopy, as well as graded for colour fading using
   SDC Grey Scale for Assessing Change in Colour (including half steps).
   Results show that in both fibre types, photodegradation occurs in all
   samples, however, the degree of fading is shown to vary within a given
   fibre population showing it is unpredictable in nature.}},

Abstract = {{The current analytical techniques for characterizing printing and
   graphic arts substrates, particularly those used to date and
   authenticate provenance, are destructive. This limits the amount of data
   that can be captured from an individual sample. For samples being
   evaluated in forensic and archeological investigations, any loss or
   degradation of the materials is undesirable. Furthermore, it is
   difficult to produce statistically relevant data for such analytes. We
   have shown elsewhere that a contactless microwave resonant cavity
   dielectric spectroscopy technique can discriminate between paper samples
   made from different plant fiber species based on their lignin content.
   In this publication, we demonstrate the utility of the contactless
   resonant cavity dielectric spectroscopy (RCDS) technique in the
   characterization of naturally and artificially aged paper samples. Based
   on our experimental results, we suggest that the technique could be used
   in forensic and archeological investigations of unique paper products.}},

Abstract = {{DNA is one of the fastest growing tools in forensic sciences, increasing
   reliability in forensic reports and judgments. The use of DNA has
   increased in different areas of the forensic sciences, such as
   investigation of plant species, where plastid DNA has been used to
   elucidate and generate evidence in cases of traceability of genetically
   modified and controlled plants. Even with several advances and the
   practice of using DNA in forensic investigations, there are just few
   studies related to the identification of genetic tools for the
   characterization of drug and nondrug-types of Cannabis. Herein, the
   whole plastomes of two drug-type Cannabis are presented and have their
   structures compared with other Cannabis plastomes deposited in the
   GenBank, focusing in the forensic use of plastome sequences. The
   plastomes of Cannabis sativa ``Brazuka{''} and of the hybrid Cannabis AK
   Royal Automatic presented general structure that does not differs from
   the reported for other C. sativa cultivars. A phylogenomic analyses
   grouped C. sativa ``Brazuka{''} with the nondrug C. sativa cultivars,
   while the hybrid Cannabis AK Royal Automatic placed isolated, basal to

Abstract = {{In deaths due to electrocution intraepidermal separation, vacuolation of
   epidermal cells, ``swiss cheese{''} aspect of the superficial part of
   epidermis (swollen and with multiple vescicles), metallization, necrosis
   of collagenous fibers, cardiomyocytes alterations are microscopically
   described. No cardiac nerve damage due to electricity is actually
   reported in literature. In this work we tried to find new morphological
   signs in the hearts of deaths due to electrocution.
   In three cases of deaths due to electrocution, in which forensic
   autopsies were performed within 36 h of the death, heart specimens were
   taken at the level of common trunk of the left coronary artery. The
   myocardium histological examination at optical microscope and Confocal
   Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) revealed fragmentation of
   cardiomyocytes, nerve trunks damage with hydropic swelling of the nerve
   fibers, interstitial and sub-nerve-sheath edema, very dishomogenous
   distribution of the natural fluorescence of the neurofilaments,
   coarctation of epicardial gangliar cells with cytoplasmic cleft and
   irregular fluorescence pattern. Identification of S-100 protein by
   immunohistochemistry can help to better observe the hydropic swelling of
   the nerve fibers and the central cytoplasmic clefts. These alterations
   could be used in future as specific signs of the passage of the
   electrical current through the heart. We recommend heart specimens at
   the level of common trunk of the left coronary artery in all the cases
   of suspected electrocution, to better evaluate cardiac nerve trunks
   damages and alterations.}},

Abstract = {{This work characterizes fundamental features of static drip patterns
   simulated for forensic bloodstain pattern analysis. The purpose of this
   study was to determine if and how two independent variables, impact
   velocity and droplet number, influence the parent stain size, shape and
   satellite spatter distribution of drip patterns created with whole ovine
   blood. To do this, 500 drip patterns were created in a controlled
   environment at five varying impact velocities and ten different droplet
   numbers on a hard paper surface. Digital images of the dried patterns
   were processed and analyzed using Fiji (ImageJ). The data collected from
   each pattern support the hypotheses that drip patterns contain
   predictable and reproducible elements based on impact velocity and
   droplet number. Basic fluid dynamic principles demonstrate that the size
   of the parent stains, as well as the number and distribution of
   satellite stains increase with increasing Weber number. A decrease in
   the circularity of the parent stains was also noted. This study provides
   fundamental qualitative and quantitative data on observable elements of
   drip patterns that can be used practically by bloodstain pattern
   analysts for pattern identification and classification. (C) 2019

Title = {{The transfer of fibres via weapons from garments}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{301}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Stabbings have been reported as the most frequent violent crime in
   countries where there is a severe restriction on obtaining firearms,
   such as the United Kingdom. Knives, scissors, and screwdrivers, as
   studied in this research, are among the most commonly encountered
   weapons involving stabbing events. When any of these implements are used
   in a stabbing, there is potential for the garment(s) worn by the victim
   to be damaged. In such an instance, there is an opportunity for fibres
   to be transferred to the weapon used, thus providing forensic evidence
   of proof of transfer from the victim's clothing to the weapon. This can
   offer valuable information in establishing what weapon was used to harm
   the victim through linking fibres from the victim's garment(s) to a
   weapon recovered from a suspect.
   This research simulates vertical stabbings - performed by a human
   participant - in to a polystyrene block supporting the clothing
   (essentially acting as the victim's torso), to reflect an authentic
   scenario. The aforementioned weapons were used along with 3 varieties of
   garments (cotton, polyester and a linen/viscose mix) offering different
   characteristics of shedability and structure for the simulated
   stabbings. Low power microscopy was utilised to view the transferred
   fibres. The amount of fibres transferred on to the implement were
   recorded for each repeat. 2279 individual fibres were found over 10
   repeats from the knife in relation to the linen/viscose garment. This
   was the highest amount of transference found with the lowest number
   attributed to the screwdriver-polyester relationship, providing 320
   recorded fibres over 10 repeats. The findings of this study suggest that
   the number of fibres transferred is not only related to the shedability
   of the garment but also the surface area characteristics of the
   receiving weapon and the ability for the garment to tear. (C) 2019

Title = {{The Troponin-I fast skeletal muscle is reliable marker for the
   determination of vitality in the suicide hanging}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{301}},
Pages = {{284-288}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Troponin I (TnI) is the inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex in
   the sarcomeric thin filament of striated muscle and plays a central role
   in the calcium regulation of contraction and relaxation. Vertebrate TnI
   has evolved into three isoforms encoded by three homologous genes: TNNI1
   for slow skeletal muscle TnI, TNNI2 for fast skeletal muscle TnI and
   TNNI3 for cardiac TnI, which are expressed under muscle type-specific
   and developmental regulations in both the atrium and ventricle of the
   heart. Skeletal muscle TnI (both sTnI iso-forms) have been proposed as a
   sensitive and fast fiber-specific serum marker of skeletal muscle
   damage; fsTnI concentration in increased peripheral blood when fast
   twitch fibers were damaged. In our study we investigate if the `Troponin
   I, fast skeletal muscle' can also be used as a reliable diagnostic tool
   in forensic practice, to perform differential diagnosis about vitality
   in suicide by hanging and simulated hanging (suspension of the victim
   after murder). We selected 8 women and 13 men, mean age 52.2 years, who
   died from suicidal hanging. The ligature material used for hanging was
   soft material in 11 cases and hard material in 10 cases. We chose cases
   as a control group of adults (n = 10; six women, four men, mean age 47.3
   years) that died from opioid overdose (n = 2), car accident (n = 3) and
   sudden cardiac death (n = 5). Those deaths were characterized by their
   rapidity. To test the Anti-Troponin I fast skeletal muscle Antibody
   (Abcam clone-134,838), we used a case of a subject who died of
   myocardial infarction (timing infarct dated to 24-36 h prior to death).
   The reactions to Troponin I (namely the amount and extent of marker
   depletion) was scored for each section from 0 to -3: 0 = no loss of
   staining; -1 = minimal decrease in staining, compared to normally
   stained tissue; -2 = clear decrease in staining with some positivity
   (brown color) remaining; and -3 = no positive (brown) staining. The set
   of results obtained leads us to believe that the use of this antibody
   (Anti-Troponin I fast skeletal muscle antibody) is very promising to be
   able to make a certain differential diagnosis between antemortem and
   postmortem hangings. It should be emphasized that the present study
   seems to open new and promising horizons in the possibility to
   discriminate between suicidal hanging and simulated hanging (suspension
   of the victim after murder). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tape-lifts can be used for the removal of a range of evidence types
   without damaging the substrate. In addition to loosely adhering material
   such as hairs and fibres, tape-lifts can be used to remove latent
   cellular material on clothing that had originated from the wearer's body
   or mouth. Common forensic practice is to examine the entire tape-lift in
   a non-targeted approach. An innovative field of research uses DNA
   binding dyes for the detection of latent DNA. This research describes
   the use of these DNA binding dyes as a DNA-targeted screening tool for
   tape-lifts. The individual cells can be visualized allowing the relevant
   area of the tape to be removed for subsequent DNA typing. Full single
   source DNA profiles were generated that matched the expected control
   sample after staining tape-lifts with two different dyes. Direct
   amplification was undertaken from tape-lifts of samples where biological
   material had been deposited over 12 months previously, from which a DNA
   profile matching the donor was obtained. The process outlines an
   effective means to visualize the presence of cellular material from
   which STR profiles can be generated allowing a targeted approach to be

Abstract = {{The estimation of the post mortem interval (PMI) is still one of the
   most challenging variables to determine and the different approaches
   currently used in its estimation generally yield to large post mortem
   windows.
   In the present study we combined morphological and immunohistochemical
   analysis in order to reach a more detailed knowledge on tissue
   organization and degradation after death. Ultrastructural cellular
   changes and the extracellular matrix of gingival tissues, collected at
   different post mortem intervals, were observed by a Transmission
   Electron Microscopy (TEM), in combination with the immunohistochemical
   detection of extracellular matrix proteins (i.e. collagen type I and
   collagen type III) as potential post mortem biochemical markers. The
   final goal was to find a correlation between morphological
   modifications, biomarkers expression and the time of death.
   Samples of gingival tissues obtained from 10 cadavers at different post
   mortem intervals (short post mortem interval, 1-3 days; mid post mortem
   interval, 4-6 days; long post mortem interval, 7-9 days) were processed
   for light microscopy and TEM and they were also immunostained with
   anti-collagen type I and type III antibodies.
   Results showed gradual degradation of extracellular matrix in the
   suboral connective tissue in relation to the different time of death.
   Moreover PMI was related to an increase of nuclear chromatin
   condensation and cytoplasmic vacuolization both in epithelial and
   connective tissues.
   In conclusion, in addition to traditional forensic approaches to
   estimate PMI, the combined analyses of cellular morphology,
   ultrastructure and immunohistochemical expression of collagen proteins
   allow to better infer the PMI.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to assess the usefulness of thin layer
   chromatography (TLC) for discriminating single cotton fibres dyed with
   red reactive dyes. An effective enzymatic extraction procedure with the
   use of cellulase for the red reactively-dyed cotton fibres was developed
   and used for the discrimination of fibres derived from 21 garments
   purchased commercially. Discrimination of the fibres relied on the
   separation of the extracted dyes by thin layer chromatography (TLC).
   Four eluents were used to develop the plates with the extracted dyes,
   and the obtained results were analysed using, among others, video
   spectral comparator (VSC). Observation of TLC plates in visible,
   ultraviolet and infrared light allowed unambiguous discrimination of 5
   and probable discrimination of 6 of the 21 fibres tested. The remaining
   fibres were divided into several groups. Comparison of the acquired
   results with those obtained for the same examination material by
   standard non-destructive methods used in forensic fibres examinations
   (transmitted light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, UV-Vis
   microspectrophotometry and Raman spectroscopy) has shown that efficiency
   in fibres differentiation is similar for all methods. TLC coupled with

Abstract = {{Fibers are an important form of forensic evidence, but their evidential
   value can be severely limited when the identified characteristics of the
   fibers are common, such as blue cotton. Detecting chemical fiber
   treatments offers an avenue to further classify fibers and to improve
   their evidential value. In this report, we investigate the potential of
   fluoropolymer fiber coatings, used to impart oil and water-repellent
   properties in fabrics, for differentiating between fibers. The thin
   nature of these fiber surface modifications creates an analytical
   challenge for their detection on a single fiber, a typical sample size
   for forensic evidence. Specifically, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (py-GC-MS) has shown promising selectivity but the
   sensitivity of the method is not adequate for single-fiber analysis of
   fluorinated coatings. To overcome this challenge, we utilize a newly
   developed elemental ionization source, plasma-assisted reaction chemical
   ionization (PARCI). The high sensitivity of py-GC-PARCI-MS for elemental
   fluorine analysis offers selective and sensitive detection of
   fluorinated pyrolysates among the non-fluorinated pyrolysates of the
   fiber core. As a result, fluoropolymer coatings are detected from 10-mm
   single-fiber samples. The technique is applied for classification of 22
   fiber types, resulting in 4 distinct groups via hierarchical cluster
   analysis based on similarity of fluorine pyrograms. These results
   present the first study to classify fibers based on fluorinated
   coatings, and highlight the potential of py-GC-PARCI-MS for forensic
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of hydrocarbons present in gasoline residues on household
   materials was investigated via inverse gas chromatography (IGC). A
   series of hydrocarbons (n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, toluene,
   p-xylene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) and three household materials
   (carpet fibers, cotton fabric, and cardboard) were selected in this
   work. IGC measurements using columns packed with these household
   materials were conducted to obtain molar enthalpies of adsorption of the
   selected hydrocarbons over the temperature range of 40 to 70 degrees C.
   Adsorption isotherms and Henry's law solubility coefficients (S) were
   also determined at 40 degrees C. Results from our IGC measurements
   revealed that molar enthalpies of adsorption, adsorption isotherms, and
   solubility coefficients were largely dependent upon the structures and
   size of hydrocarbons and the choice of solid substrates. Measured molar
   enthalpies of adsorption became more exothermic with increasing size of
   hydrocarbons, ranging from -23.4 to -40.9 kJ/mol for carpet fibers,
   -36.2 to -48.2 kJ/mol for cotton fabric, and -30.1 to -52.5 kJ/mol for
   cardboard. From the adsorption isotherms and the measured retention
   times as a function of the injection amount, the adsorption affinity of
   hydrocarbons to the carpet fibers was found to be weaker than the
   affinity between hydrocarbon molecules, producing relatively lower
   solubility coefficients for all hydrocarbons than those measured on
   cotton fabric and cardboard. However, the adsorption affinities of
   hydrocarbons to both cotton fabric and cardboard were much stronger with
   increased solubility coefficients presumably due to the diffusion and
   dispersion of hydrocarbons through solid substrates. In particular,
   solubility coefficients of three aromatics on cardboard were
   significantly larger than those measured on carpet fibers and cotton
   fabric. This might be responsible for previously reported enhanced
   persistence of gasoline residues spiked on cardboard. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {{New Insight into Hellenistic and Roman Cypriot Wall Paintings: An
   Exploration of Artists' Materials, Production Technology, and Technical
   Style}},
Journal = {{ARTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A recent scientific investigation on Hellenistic and Roman wall
   paintings of funerary and domestic contexts from Nea (New') Paphos,
   located in the southwest region of Cyprus, has revealed new information
   on the paintings' constituent materials, their production technology and
   technical style of painting. Nea Paphos, founded in the late 4th century
   BC, became the capital of the island during the Hellenistic period
   (294-58 BC) and developed into a thriving economic center that continued
   through the Roman period (58 BC-330 AD). A systematic, analytical study
   of ancient Cypriot wall paintings, excavated from the wealthy residences
   of Nea Paphos and the surrounding necropoleis, combining complementary
   non-invasive, field-deployable characterization techniques, has expanded
   the scope of analysis, interpretation and access of these paintings. The
   results from in situ analyses, combining X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and
   fiber-optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS), forensic imaging in
   reflectance and luminescence, and digital photomicrography, were
   informative on the raw materials selection, application technique(s) and
   extent of paintings beyond the visible. Data collected through the
   integration of these techniques were able to: (1) show an intricate and
   rich palette of pigments consisting of local and foreign natural
   minerals and synthetic coloring compounds applied pure or in mixtures,
   in single or multiple layers; (2) identify and map the spatial
   distribution of Egyptian blue across the surface of the paintings,
   revealing the extent of imagery and reconstructing iconography that was
   no longer visible to the naked eye; and (3) visualize and validate the
   presence of Egyptian blue to delineate facial contours and flesh tone
   shading. This innovation and technical characteristic in the manner of
   painting facial outlines and constructing chiaroscuro provides a new
   insight into the artistic practices, inferring artists/or workshops'
   organization in Cyprus during the Roman period.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a study regarding the forensic discrimination of
   black inkjet-printed documents in question. Nondestructive Fourier
   transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy in combination with
   supervised classification method Discriminant Analysis (DA); Linear
   Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
   were utilized to investigate 22 different prints of the three most sold
   office printer brands. The spectra were acquired using the FT-NIR
   spectrometer NIRFlex N-500 (Buchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland)
   with the Fiber Optic Solids measuring cell in the spectral region of
   10,000-4000 cm( 1). Each sample was printed on the same type of office
   paper. The spectra were 45 times acquired on 3 separate printed squares
   of each sample. It results in 990 acquired spectra for the presented
   experiment. The FT-NIR spectra of the printed squares were split into
   calibration and test sets with which the Classification accuracy (CA)
   value of unknown samples was evaluated. In order to increase the
   significance, three different compilations of calibration and test sets
   were realized. The performance of three different Discriminant model
   methods; LDA (Euclidean and Mahalanobis algorithm) and QDA were compared
   to each other. Furthermore, the CA of each DA method was examined using
   1-5 principal components (PCs) in the construction of the respective DA
   model. Two groups of models, according to the ink subset (Carbon black
   and Black colorant), were performed in raw and Standard Normal Variate
   (SNV) correction spectra alternations. The results showed that the
   Euclidean method yielded the highest accuracy in predicting independent
   test samples and thus clearly outperformed the QDA and Mahalanobis
   algorithm DA method. It was also determined that the ink type Carbon
   black had higher CA values than the ink type Black colorant. This work
   demonstrated the special ability of FT-NIR spectroscopy in combination
   with DA to examine inkjet-printed documents in a fast and
   non-destructive fashion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of cannabis has gained new importance worldwide, mainly for
   quality control within the legalized recreational and medical cannabis
   industry, but also for forensic differentiation between drug-type
   cannabis and legal products such as fiber hemp and CBD-rich/THC-poor
   cannabis. We herein present an HPLC-DAD method for quantitative analysis
   of major neutral and acidic cannabinoids in herbal cannabis and hashish:
   Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic
   acid A (THCA), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and
   cannabinol (CBN). Plant material was dried, homogenized and extracted
   with a mixture of methanol/hexane. Chromatographic separation of the
   analytes was achieved on a core-shell C8 column using gradient elution
   with water/acetonitrile containing 0.1\% formic acid. The analytical run
   time was 13 min and analytes were detected at 210 nm. The method is
   selective, sensitive, accurate, and precise, as confirmed through
   validation according to ICH and AOAC guidelines. Linearity in herbal
   cannabis ranged from 0.04 to 4.00\% for the neutral cannabinoids, and
   from 0.40 to 20\% for the acids. Linear ranges in hashish samples were
   0.13-13.33\% and 1.33-66.66\%, respectively. The presented method was
   successfully applied to characterize 110 cannabis samples seized by the
   Swiss police, demonstrating its applicability for routine cannabis
   potency testing in the forensic setting. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The ability of extraction and preconcentration of small quantities of
   substances from biological samples is important in analytical sciences,
   particularly forensic medicine. In the present study, we evaluated the
   binding potential of amino acids to produce a new solid phase
   microextraction fiber based on carbon nanotube (CNTs) for extraction and
   preconcentration of small amount of morphine in urine sample. Raw CNTs
   were first carboxylated and then functionalized with 3 amino acids
   including glutamate, arginine, and cysteine. Functionalization was
   confirmed by FTIR analysis, Raman spectroscopy and SEM imaging. The
   functionalized CNTs were coated on polypropylene hollow fiber and used
   for preconcentration. The results of HPLC analysis in isocratic elution
   mode using acetonitrile-sodium acetate (10:90, v/v; pH 4; 0.01 M) as the
   mobile phase showed that amino acids are able to adsorb morphine and the
   prepared fiber could preconcentrate a very low concentration of morphine
   (0.25 ppb) in urine matrix. In addition, the fiber was successfully used
   for up to 30 times with no significant loss in the extraction
   efficiency. Lowest limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation
   (LOQ) was 0.07 and 0.25, respectively. Also, the lowest and best
   recovery of the fiber was 87.8\% and 139\% at LOQ, which belonged to
   glutamate and arginine, respectively. The fibers based on amino acids
   can be used for the detection of a small amount of morphine in
   biological samples, which are not detectable by conventional methods.
   Simple mechanism of these fibers in preconcentrating morphine makes them
   a novel candidate for detection of other opiates and drugs of abuses in
   crime scene investigations and postmortem examinations several days
   after exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Explosives are of significant interest to homeland security departments
   and forensic investigations. Fast, sensitive and selective detection of
   these chemicals is of great concern for security purposes as well as for
   triage and decontamination in contaminated areas. To this end, selective
   sorbents with fast binding kinetics and high binding capacity, either in
   combination with a sensor transducer or a sampling/sample-preparation
   method, are required. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) show promise
   as cost-effective and rugged artificial selective sorbents, which have a
   wide variety of applications. This manuscript reviews the innovative
   strategies developed in 57 manuscripts (published from 2006 to 2019) to
   use MIP materials for explosives. To the best of our knowledge, there
   are currently no commercially available MIP-modified sensors or sample
   preparation methods for explosives in the market. We believe that this
   review provides information to give insight into the future prospects
   and potential commercialization of such materials. We warn the readers
   of the hazards of working with explosives.}},

Abstract = {{Prior work has shown that the contact surfaces of footwear rapidly lose
   very small particles (VSP) when walking on dry soil. Other research,
   with more general sampling from shoe soles, has shown that particles can
   persist much longer. Given rapid losses from contact surfaces, we
   hypothesize that non-contact, recessed areas of footwear retain
   particles from prior exposures. Here we conduct differential analysis of
   VSP recovered separately from contact and recessed surfaces, following a
   controlled series of environmental exposures.
   Work boots and tennis shoes were exposed by walking distances of 250 m,
   sequentially, in three environmental sites. VSP were harvested
   separately from contact and recessed surfaces using a moist swabbing
   procedure. VSP were analyzed by microscopy and the proportions
   attributable to each site were determined using a newly developed
   statistical model.
   The principal findings are (1) contact surfaces of footwear are
   dominated by VSP attributable to the most recent site of exposure, (2)
   recessed surfaces of footwear retain VSP from prior exposures, (3) sole
   type appears to be a source of major differences in the amount of VSP
   from prior exposures remaining in recessed areas, and (4) when VSP
   attributable to prior exposures are found, there is no clear trend for
   dominance between earlier exposures.
   The significance of these findings is considerable. In cases where the
   last site visited is of interest, VSP from contact surfaces of footwear
   will give a nearly pure sample of that site. In cases where prior sites
   visited are of interest, the VSP from the contact surfaces can be used
   as a background signal, providing a means for differential analysis of
   VSP mixtures found in the recessed areas of the sole. The strong
   influence of shoe sole type on the retention of VSP from prior exposures
   indicates that efforts to explore the rates of VSP loss from recessed
   areas will need to take characteristics of the sole type into account.
   The absence of a clear trend for dominance between earlier exposures
   suggests that once traces are lodged within the recessed areas of
   footwear soles they can be retained for long periods of time. These
   findings support prior research on the retention of particles on
   footwear that shows periods of long retention following rapid initial
   losses of trace materials.
   The differential analysis of VSP is a significant contribution to the
   methods available for the deconvolution of particle mixtures into
   fractions that are characteristic of their contributing sources. (C)

   also found that blood that deposited on the fabric wicked only in the
   direction of the fibers at that location within the fabric which led to
   distorted stain shapes. Fewer observed impact spatter stains were found
   on cotton jersey knits for fabrics made with larger yarns than on paper.

Abstract = {{Sexual assault is a serious crime that often has low conviction rates.
   Recent literature has demonstrated that there is potential for
   fragrances to be valuable in forensic reconstructions where there has
   been contact between individuals. However, developing appropriate
   evidence bases for understanding the nature of fragrance transfer in
   these contexts is needed. This article presents three experiments that
   address the transfer process of fragrances that have been transferred
   from a primary piece of fabric onto a secondary piece of fabric, in a
   manner that could occur during an assault. The three variables studied
   were the ageing time of the fragrances on the first fabric prior to
   transfer, the contact time between the two fabrics, and lastly the
   fabric type (of the primary material and the recipient material). The
   transfer was evaluated using a validated solid phase micro-extraction
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC MS) method. The findings
   demonstrated that all three variables had an impact on the transfer of
   fragrances between clothing fabrics. Generally, lower volatility
   compounds were transferred and recovered in larger amounts than higher
   volatility compounds. All fragrance compounds were successfully
   recovered from a secondary piece of fabric even when the contact time
   was as short as 10 s, and even when the perfume was aged on the primary
   fabric for as long as 48 h. The nature of the fragrance transfer also
   depended on the fabric type, so that a clear discrimination was observed
   between the fragrance transfer that occurred onto a natural fabric
   (cotton) and onto a synthetic fabric (polyester).}},

Title = {{The effect of tape type, taping method and tape storage temperature on
   the retrieval rate of fibres from various surfaces: An example of data
   generation and analysis to facilitate trace evidence recovery validation
   and optimisation}},

Abstract = {{This paper aspires to assist those tasked with data generation and
   analysis for the purpose of the validation and/or optimisation of trace
   evidence recovery. It does so via a detailed report of the authors'
   approach to this problem in the context of target fibre retrieval using
   self-adhesive tapes.
   Textile-fibres can provide valuable evidence at both source and activity
   levels. This ability stems from their near ubiquity in the man-made
   environment, their potential for high levels of discrimination
   (especially when found in combination) and their reproducible transfer
   and persistence behaviours. To realise this value for the criminal
   justice system, it is vital that police forces and forensic providers
   are collectively able to search for, recover and analyse fibres found at
   crime scenes and correctly evaluate their evidential value.
   ISO accreditation provides quality assurance for such activities. The
   work reported in this paper was part of a study to validate crime scene
   fibre retrieval processes for the purposes of ISO17020 accreditation.
   However, it is hoped that it will be of assistance to those wishing to
   validate and/or optimise forensic fibre recovery whether at the crime
   scene or in the laboratory. Further, the methods described may be of
   value to those who need to validate and/or optimise the recovery of
   other types of trace evidence.
   This paper outlines a series of experiments that investigated the effect
   of four factors on the rate at which target fibres could be recovered
   from surfaces by tape lifting. The factors were tape type (with two
   levels, namely: J-LAR and Crystal Tabs), tape storage temperature (three
   levels: -5 degrees C, room temperature {[}19 +/- 1 degrees C] and 35
   degrees C), taping method (two levels: zonal and one-to-one) and surface
   (12 levels: each being a surface type commonly encountered at crime
   scenes). This resulted in 144 unique experimental conditions. For each
   of these, five repeat fibre recovery rate determinations were carried
   out, generating 720 data points. All surfaces were clean and dry prior
   to target fibres being transferred and recovered. In all cases, the
   tapes were applied to the surfaces at 19 +/- 1 degrees C.
   These experiments showed that the surfaces can be divided into three
   stable clusters based on the median and interquartile range of the fibre
   retrieval rate achieved from each of them. Also, they showed that, in
   terms of the proportion of the target fibres retrieved, typically and
   setting aside interaction effects:
   Crystal Tabs outperformed J-LAR;
   rolls of tape stored at 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C outperformed those
   stored at room temperature;
   one-to-one taping outperformed zonal taping.
   However, notably, a good degree of between-condition overlap was also
   apparent in the data. To understand this, a four-way factorial ANOVA
   model was built which revealed significant and substantive effects for
   all four main effects and for 10 of the 11 interactions. Importantly,
   the four-way interaction term was amongst those found to be significant.
   The interplay between the effects of the four factors was analysed by
   means of simple effects tests and pairwise contrasts. Tables and
   interactive parallel coordinate plots have been created. Using these it
   can easily be seen which of any given pair of levels of each of the four
   factors resulted in the higher fibre retrieval rate under any one of the
   unique conditions of the study, and the effect size and statistical
   significance of this observation.
   Qualitative evaluations of the effect of tape storage temperatures on
   tape pliability and its propensity to tear in use were also made.}},

Abstract = {{The Mawangdui tomb No.1 cadaver, a female corpse from the Western Han
   Dynasty, was unearthed in 1972. Forensic examination at the time of
   discovery indicated fairly remarkable presence of bodily constituents at
   the anatomical, histological, and molecular levels. The cadaver was
   preserved in a formalin-based fixative afterward, and maintained in the
   Hunan Museum. To better protect this rare human corpse, a reappraisal of
   the status of preservation was carried out using noninvasive approaches,
   including X-ray radiography, gross anatomical examination, and
   histological, microbiological, and molecular analyses of sampled
   tissues. The cadaver remained essentially intact from a gross anatomical
   perspective, with radiography of the skeletal system and arterial
   contrast filling appeared comparable with the original documentation.
   The light microscopic features of the skin, cartilage, and skeletal
   muscle remained detectable, as were the stratified ultrastructure of the
   collagen and muscle fibers. The levels of nitrogen and amino acidic
   elements appeared elevated in the cadaver and liver preservation
   fixatives, with a higher calcium and phosphate concentration in the
   former. These findings suggest that there existed a certain degree of
   macromolecule degradation and bone decalcification in the cadaver,
   likely irrelevant to biological decomposition. The reappraisal also led
   to the implementation of stronger scientific measures to better protect
   the cadaver through a renovated Museum-University coadministrative
   management agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The current study aims at discriminating cotton and woolen textile
   fibers from dye using UV-Vis spectroscopy and chemometrics methods. For
   extraction of the dye from fibers, seven solvent systems have been used,
   and different extraction conditions have also been tested. Two different
   approaches, i.e., a visual comparison of peaks and chemometric analysis,
   have been proposed to differentiate between the textile fibers. The
   comparison of peaks obtained through UV-Vis spectra provides the
   discrimination power of 83.6\% for cotton fibers and 94.3\% for the
   woolen fibers. However, the incorporation of chemometrics has further
   improved the discrimination power to 100\% for cotton and 98.1\% for
   woolen fibers. The discrimination of 100\% is achieved with
   nonsignificant values of the Welch's t-test, which illustrates that all
   samples are discriminated.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-phase microextraction is a well-established green solvent free
   extraction technique with a large number of applications in different
   fields such as food, forensic, biomedical, and the environment. The
   present review comprehensively describes the most recent applications
   mostly reported from 2013 of SPME for the extraction of environmental
   pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pesticides,
   and emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care
   products (PPCPs), in different environmental matrices. This review also
   covers the last technological developments including the use of novel
   extraction coatings (MOFs, CNTs, ILs), formats (e.g. TFSE), approaches
   (e.g. vacuum, cold fiber, and in-tube SPME), and on-site devices. The
   hyphenation of SPME with other techniques, especially mass spectrometry
   will be described, as well. The usefulness of SPME to follow
   (photo)degradation studies, both in target and non-target analysis, as
   well as to determine some of the physicochemical parameters governing
   the pollutant fate in the environment is also illustrated through
   different examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Undyed textile fabrics such as Acrylic 864, Nylon 361 and Cotton 400
   were pre-dyed with Basic Green 4 (BG4), Acid Yellow 17 (AY17) and Direct
   Blue 1 (DB1) dyes, respectively; and then exposed to two extremely
   diverse weather conditions in the United States: desert and humid
   environmental settings in Arizona (AZ) and Florida (FL) respectively,
   for different time intervals of exposure, which included 0, 3, 6, 9 and
   12 months. After every interval of a 3 months period, ten fibers were
   uniformly sampled from each cloth piece, and fluorescence microscopy was
   employed to collect two-dimensional excitation and fluorescence spectra
   (2-D spectra) and three-dimensional (3D) excitation-emission matrices
   (EEMs). A significant loss of fluorescence intensity was observed upon
   fiber exposure to outdoor weathering conditions. For a comprehensive
   statistical data analysis and to be able to discriminate between any two
   single fibers weathered under different conditions, a multiway
   calibration algorithm known as discriminant unfolded partial
   least-squares (DU-PLS) method was applied to the exposed fibers. Results
   indicate that fluorescence spectroscopy combined with DU-PLS has the
   ability to appropriately classify and differentiate between any two
   pairs of dyed cotton or nylon fibers (acrylic in some cases) exposed to
   dry versus humid weather environments under different time intervals of
   exposure. These results provide the foundation for future studies
   towards a non-destructive approach capable to provide information on the
   weathering history of the fiber.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past three decades, many studies employing hollow-fiber
   liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) bioanalytical methods have been
   published. The basic mechanism of extraction relies on the migration of
   the analytes through a liquid membrane sustained in the pores of the
   walls of a porous hollow fiber, and from there into an acceptor phase
   present in the lumen of the fiber. The mass transfer occurs by passive
   diffusion and it can be enhanced by using a carrier or applying an
   electrical potential across the phases. This type of extraction method
   presents many advantages over classical techniques, such as high
   preconcentration factor, clean extracts, and a green chemistry approach.
   Due to its advantages, and considering that no study systematically
   compiled the characteristics of the published methods in one single
   accessible source of information, the aim of this systematic review is
   to assess the data regarding bioanalytical methods, compile, and analyse
   the studies published until up to October of 2017. The data source used
   for the systematic review were Pubmed, Web of Science, and Science
   Direct, and 171 studies were included in the final review by two
   independent reviewers, resulting in a reliable and accessible source of
   information about bioanalytical methods employing HF-LPME.}},

Abstract = {{In forensic laboratories, the most commonly analyzed microtraces are
   microscopic fragments of single fibers. One of the main goals of the
   examination of fragments of fibers a few millimeters long is to
   determine their characteristic physicochemical properties and compare
   them with fibers originating from a known source (e.g., a suspect's
   clothes). The color and dyes of fiber microtraces play an important role
   in their research and evaluation, being analyzed by means of
   microscopic, spectroscopic, and chromatographic methods. The results of
   examinations conducted with the use of spectroscopic techniques might be
   ambiguous due to overlapping bands of absorption and the transmission
   and dispersion of electromagnetic radiation corresponding to the
   specific chemical structure of the fibers and their dyes. For this
   reason, it is very important to improve currently available
   spectroscopic methods and/or to propose new ones that allow evidential
   materials to be analyzed in a much more reliable way. In this review,
   the possibility of the use of chromatographic techniques with different
   detection systems for such analyses is underlined. This review covers
   the different analytical methods used in the forensic analysis of
   polyester fibers dyed with disperse dyes. Polyester fibers occupy the
   first position among synthetic fibers in their use for a variety of
   purposes, and disperse dyes are commonly applied for dyeing them.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic science can be broadly defined as the application of any of the
   scientific method to solving a crime. Within forensic science there are
   many different disciplines, however, for the majority of them, five main
   concepts shape the nature of forensic examination: transfer,
   identification, classification/individualization, association, and
   reconstruction. The concepts of identification,
   classification/individualization, and association rely greatly on
   analytical chemistry techniques. It is, therefore, no stretch to see how
   one of the rising stars of analytical chemistry techniques, Raman
   spectroscopy, could be of use. Raman spectroscopy is known for needing a
   small amount of sample, being non-destructive, and very substance
   specific, all of which make it ideal for analyzing crime scene evidence.
   The purpose of this chapter is to show the state of new methods
   development for forensic applications based on Raman spectroscopy
   published between 2015 and 2017.}},

   concrete, masonry, or other materials. Timber products sequester a
   significant amount of carbon in comparison to the amount of carbon
   released during harvest, manufacture, and transport. Timber structures
   have generally performed well in earthquakes and wind storms if
   constructed according to the building codes and good construction
   practice. Timber structures often have a cost advantage over other types
   of structures. These advantages are lost when timber structures fail
   prematurely and the structure needs substantial repair or replacement
   early in its life cycle. Many forensic studies have been made of single
   structures, but these studies have not been performed using consistent
   criteria or methods nor have the conclusions been examined with respect
   to other structures. Often authors of these studies at engineering
   conferences are not experts in wood and fiber science. This paper
   examines and classifies the types of defects seen in timber structures,
   and provides recommendations that practicing engineers can use to reduce
   or control these defects. Learning from the mistakes and the design
   errors of others are fundamental methods used to improve structural
   design. Structural engineers of the future need to reflect on the
   knowledge derived from the past. Lessons learned from these studies can
   lead to reduced defects in the future and to enhancing the sustainable
   nature of wood construction. This paper will broaden the knowledge of
   practicing engineers to assist them to be experts in sustainability and
   good stewards of materials and the built environment.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic evaluation of crime scenes normally involves examination of
   textile fibers, to find out the association between an individual and a
   crime scene, or between a suspect and a victim. The forensic samples
   normally include a mix of various types, sizes (micro to nano - scale)
   and shapes of natural and synthetic fibers, which are very difficult to
   differentiate/identify. Various sophisticated analytical instruments are
   being used to carry out the examination of these fibers. They involve
   various microscopy and spectroscopy based techniques, most of which are
   very complex and highly sensitive. Further, they may require a series of
   sample preparation steps to get high selectivity and are highly time
   consuming. Here we report a fluorescence microscopy based synthetic
   (plastic) fiber detection method using Nile Red (NR) dye, which provides
   high selectivity for synthetic fibers. The methodology involves the use
   of NR dye which selectively stains the fibers collected on filter papers
   following separation from samples/soils and water. The selectivity of NR
   towards the fibers is due to their non-polar property. Binding with NR
   makes the fibers fluoresce when viewed under a fluorescence microscope.
   This selectivity of NR for fibers makes the identification of fibers lot
   easier and less time-consuming in forensic samples when compared to the
   more commonly used optical microscopy (where the presence of
   naturally-occurring substances of similar size can result in more
   errors). The paper will discuss optimisation of various parameters and
   method validation for detection of synthetic fibers and microplastics
   from soil samples. As an example, our method has shown to provide
   distinct clarity for the analysis of microfibers. The potential for the
   application of the method for faster forensics analysis will be
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Current chemical detection techniques are not feasible in rugged
   environments where speed of detection, autonomous operation, and
   compactness are crucial factors. In this study, we investigate the
   promising photonic crystal structure of porous silicon (pSi) for
   portable sensing. HF-ethanol electrolyte with Pt/Al electrodes and a
   sinusoidal current oscillating between 15 mA and 108 mA was used to
   electrochemically etch p(++)-type porous silicon optical rugate filters
   with a 50\% porosity. The samples were hydroxylated in ozone gas and
   functionalized through a ring-opening living polymerization reaction
   with a heterocyclic silane to retain thermal and alkaline stability.
   ATR-FTIR spectra and SEM confirmed the ring-opening reaction with
   grafting via O-Si bonds to the pSi surface. Hydrophobicity was
   demonstrated by water contact angles of 120-130 degrees. A stable
   stopband was maintained after varying thermal and alkaline conditions.
   After confirming pSi stability, a broad range of VOCs were cycled
   through a pressurized flow chamber and a bifurcated optical fiber CCD
   spectrometer continuously monitored for changes in the reflected
   stopband of the sensor. Target library VOCs underwent microcapillary
   condensation in pSi cavities, changing the composite refractive index
   and producing predictable optical stopband shifts with a precision
   within 0.03 nm for pure VOCs and 0.79 nm for complex mixtures and a
   threshold detection concentration of 1 microgram per cubic meter. With a
   precision which parallels state-of-the-art chemical detection methods,
   as well as high stability and portability, this nanosensor is viable in
   chemical detection systems for real-time air quality monitoring,
   military defense, and forensic analysis.}},

Abstract = {{For many forensic traces (inks, fibres, paints, ...) the chemical
   characterization of dyes or pigments is currently performed with
   reliable techniques that nonetheless show a few drawbacks (extraction,
   interfering signals, fluorescence). The forensic community could benefit
   from a less labor intensive method that provides high sensitivity to
   detect trace amounts of dyes ( < 5\% weight) without matrix
   interference. Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is rapidly
   gaining interest in the forensic community for these particular reasons
   and is often cited as a technique of choice for dyes analysis. It
   remains however a specialized technique limited to well equipped
   laboratories for which substrates synthesis represent the largest
   constraint. In order to popularize its use, we present a simple
   synthesis of SERS substrates (less than 2 min heating time) using a
   conventional microwave furnace. The technique is fast, inexpensive and
   yields plasmonic silver nanoparticles suitable for many SERS
   applications. We optimize the heating time and microwave power (watts),
   and verify the plasmonic resonance using UV-Visible spectroscopy. The
   produced colloids possess a mean diameter of 35-40 nm, ideal for SERS
   experiments with a laser excitation in the blue-green, and are stable
   for months. We demonstrate the suitability of these colloids with the
   analysis of 11 dyes from different chemical categories, analyzed by both
   standard Raman and SERS. We infer the interaction mechanism between the
   dyes and the substrate as well as the contribution from molecular,
   surface plasmon, and charge transfer resonances. These results open up
   new possibilities for trace analysis of dyes and might contribute to
   promote its use in forensic and chemistry laboratories.}},

Title = {{Microscopic Characteristics Of Scalp Hair Subjected To Cultural Styling
   Methods In Ghanaian African Females}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL COSMETIC AND INVESTIGATIONAL DERMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{843-850}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To provide data for forensic use and provoke ideas to preserve
   shaft integrity, we studied micro structural alterations of female scalp
   hair subjected to Ghanaian cultural styling methods. Hence,
   topographical features of female hairs styled by braiding/weaving, and
   chemical relaxation sampled from five different scalp regions were
   assessed and compared with natural (Afro) hair.
   Subjects and methods: Ninety-six indigenous Ghanaian females volunteered
   480 hairs, which were analyzed by light microscopy. Hairs were plucked
   using a pair of cosmetologist's tweezers from frontal, left temporal,
   right temporal, vertex, and occipital regions of the scalp. Hairs were
   categorized by their grooming styles as Afro (natural-unstyled),
   natural-styled (weaved/braided), and chemically relaxed. These were
   studied according to shaft/medulla dimensions and conventional cuticular
   scale features, and comparisons were made between styling procedures and
   scalp regions.
   Results: Chemically styled hair had the widest shaft diameter, but the
   lowest incidence of continuous medullation. Medullary diameter and index
   increased from chemically relaxed, natural-styled, to Afro hair. A
   positive but modest correlation between shaft and medullary diameters
   existed for Afro (r = 0.320, p = 0.011) and natural-styled hairs (r =
   0.235, p = 0.022) but not chemically relaxed hair (r = 0.122, p = 0.2).
   Scale margins were predominantly smooth in Afro hair, crenate in
   natural-styled hair, and rippled in chemically relaxed hair. With
   respect to scalp regions, hair shaft diameter was widest in vertex hair
   and smallest in right temporal hair in all styling methods.
   Conclusion: Medulla was thickest in Afro hair, which also exhibited a
   correlation with shaft diameter in conformity with the published data.
   Chemically relaxed hairs did not exhibit these characteristics, which
   affirm altered morphology. Research on how chemicals affect these
   changes should help find antidote. The dimensional variations of hairs
   from different scalp regions are instructive for both cosmetic and
   forensic examination of hairs.}},

Abstract = {{Disorders related to the use of new psychoactive drugs (NPS) such as
   amphetamines account for a considerable share of the hospital admissions
   and fatalities attributable to drug use disorders, second only to those
   related to the abuse of opioids. According to the World Drug Report 2017
   elaborated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),
   amphetamine-like stimulants (ATS) such as methamphetamine represent the
   greatest global health threat. Hallucinogenic amphetamines, such as
   3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and its analogues, account for an
   even larger number of fatalities. The latter compounds have no medical
   use and are controlled substances in most countries. However, despite
   their high toxicity, they are abused during rave parties for their
   euphoriant effect. Hence, new analytical instruments, allowing a more
   effective in-situ screening for NPS are highly needed. The most
   important challenge for such forensic instruments is their capacity to
   scan not only for the known NPS, but also for any compound having a
   molecular structure (hence a pharmacological activity) similar to the
   already known and controlled drugs of abuse. Such a new instrument,
   built within the DIRAC EU funded project, consists of a hollow fiber
   infrared spectrometer. In order to maximize its compactivity, the
   radiation source of this spectrometer is a quantum cascade laser (QCL).
   On the other hand, the use of a laser source of infrared radiation
   raises another challenge, i.e. obtaining the same detection efficiency
   as in the case of spectrometers generating the full infrared spectrum,
   despite the narrow spectral window in which QCLs are emitting. In this
   paper we are presenting the results obtained for two experimental
   setups, which were compared in order to find the most appropriate
   infrared source. Two QCLs, emitting in the spectral windows of 1550-1330
   cm(-1) (UT7) and 1405-1150 cm(-1) (UT8) respectively, have been
   evaluated by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical
   Cluster Analysis (HCA). The initial database consisted of normalized
   spectra of the main ATS, hallucinogenic amphetamines and a similar
   number of negatives, representing miscellaneous substances of forensic
   interest. The dataset obtained by preprocessing these spectra with a
   w(MT)(2) feature weight has been used for the training process. The PCA
   plots have indicated the QCL generating the best clustering and which
   are the main absorptions that ensure a high quality class identity
   assignment. The potential cluster overlap has been assessed based on the
   estimated density distributions calculated with a normal kernel
   function. The results have been validated by using HCA, the quality of
   the clustering trees being assessed based on the cophenetic correlation
   coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) is considered by some authors to be a leading
   cause of traumatic death in children less than two years of age and
   skull fractures are commonly seen in cases of suspected AHT. Today,
   diagnosing whether the observed fractures are caused by abuse or
   accidental fall is still a challenge within both the medical and the
   legal communities and the central question is a biomechanical question:
   can the described history explain the observed fractures? Finite element
   (FE) analysis has been shown a valuable tool for biomechanical analysis
   accounting for detailed head geometry, advanced material modelling, and
   case-specific factors (e.g. head impact location, impact surface
   properties). Here, we reconstructed two well-documented suspected abuse
   cases (a 3- and a 4-month-old) using subject-specific FE head models.
   The models incorporate the anatomical details and age-dependent
   anisotropic material properties of infant cranial bones that reflect the
   grainy fibres radiating from ossification centres. The impact locations
   are determined by combining multimodality images. The results show that
   the skull fracture patterns in both cases of suspected abuse could be
   explained by the described accidental fall history, demonstrating the
   inherent potential of FE analysis for providing biomechanical evidence
   to aid forensic investigations. Increased knowledge of injury mechanisms
   in children may have enormous medico-legal implications world-wide. (C)

Abstract = {{Victim identification using dental records involves antemortem and
   postmortem comparison of dental charts. Since dental restorations may be
   part of such records, identifying them accurately is critical. The
   objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic reliability and
   validity of two optical methods for identifying tooth-colored
   restorations (digital imaging fiber optic transillumination (DiFOTI)
   using near infrared light, and fluorescence-aided identification of
   restorations (FAIR)) with conventional diagnostic methods. Four
   examiners identified and charted tooth-colored restorations in three
   sets of typodonts on the bench using conventional visual and tactile
   examination, DiFOTI (DIAGNOcam (TM)) and FAIR. All examinations were
   repeated after 4 weeks. Both the sensitivity (95\%) and specificity
   (97\%) of the FAIR method were significantly higher than those for
   DiFOTI (82\% and 82\%) and for conventional inspection (71\% and 82\%).
   In conclusion, FAIR method performed better than conventional
   examination and DiFOTI, and was more reliable for identifying
   tooth-colored restorations.}},

   Different extraction techniques are employed with the goals of removing
   interferences from the biological samples, such as blood, tissues and

   ecological procedures, microextraction techniques have been expanding
   their applications in the recent years. This article reviews various
   microextraction methods, which include solid-based microextraction, such
   as solid-phase microextraction, microextraction by packed sorbent and
   stir-bar sorptive extraction, and liquid-based microextraction, such as
   single drop/hollow fiber-based liquid-phase microextraction and
   dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction, as well as their applications
   to forensic toxicology analysis. The development trend in future

Abstract = {{Microextractions have become an attractive class of techniques for
   metabolomics. The most popular technique is solid-phase microextraction
   that revolutionized the field of modern sample preparation in the early
   nineties. Ever since this milestone, microextractions have taken on many
   principles and formats comprising droplets, fibers, membranes, needles,
   and blades. Sampling devices may be customized to impart exhaustive or
   equilibrium-based characteristics to the extraction method.
   Equilibrium-based approaches may rely on additional methods for
   calibration, such as diffusion-based or on-fiber kinetic calibration to
   improve bioanalysis. In addition, microextraction-based methods may
   enable minimally invasive sampling protocols and measure the average
   free concentration of analytes in heterogeneous multiphasic biological
   systems. On-fiber derivatization has evidenced new opportunities for
   targeted and untargeted analysis in metabolomics. All these advantages
   have highlighted the potential of microextraction techniques for in vivo
   and on-site sampling and sample preparation, while many opportunities
   are still available for laboratory protocols. In this review, we outline
   and discuss some of the most recent applications using microextractions
   techniques for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-based
   metabolomics, including potential research opportunities. (C) 2018

Journal = {{FORENSIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Textile fibers are frequently encountered as trace evidence. The
   identification and comparison of fibers is very important for case
   investigation, and an important aspect of forensic fiber examination is
   the characterization of fiber dyes. Fibers recovered at crime scenes are
   often very small and contain multiple dyes, which require a high demand
   for the sensitivity and separation efficiency of dye analysis methods.
   The combination of high performance liquid chromatography and tandem
   mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) is a highly selective and sensitive
   analytical method that can be useful for the characterization of dyes. A
   sensitive HPLC-MS/MS method is described here to analyze fiber dyes in
   different classes (acid, basic, direct, reactive, and disperse).
   Acetonitrile/water addicted with 0.1\% acetic acid was utilized as the
   mobile phase. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection
   (LOD) for different dyes reached 0.01-16.7 ng/mL in Multi Reaction
   Monitor (MRM) mode. The described method is sensitive enough to analyze
   single fibers with a length of a few millimeters or less, which makes it
   suitable for forensic analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The domestication of wild vicuna and guanaco by early pre-Inca cultures
   is an iconic example of wildlife management and domestication in the
   Americas. Although domestic llamas and alpacas were clearly selected for
   key, yet distinct, phenotypic traits, the relative patterns and
   direction of selection and domestication have not been confirmed using
   genetic approaches. However, the detailed archaeological records from
   the region suggest that domestication was a process carried out under
   significant control and planning, which would have facilitated
   coordinated and thus extremely effective selective pressure to achieve
   and maintain desired phenotypic traits. Here we link patterns of
   sequence variation in two well-characterised genes coding for colour
   variation in vertebrates and interpret the results in the context of
   domestication in guanacos and vicunas. We hypothesise that colour
   variation in wild populations of guanacos and vicunas were strongly
   selected against. In contrast, variation in coat colour variation in
   alpaca was strongly selected for and became rapidly fixed in alpacas. In
   contrast, coat colour variants in llamas were of less economic value,
   and thus were under less selective pressure. We report for the first
   time the full sequence of MC1R and 3 exons of ASIP in 171 wild specimens
   from throughout their distribution and which represented a range of
   commonly observed colour patterns. We found a significant difference in
   the number of non-synonymous substitutions, but not synonymous
   substitutions among wild and domestics species. The genetic variation in
   MC1R and ASIP did not differentiate alpaca from llama due to the high
   degree of reciprocal introgression, but the combination of 11
   substitutions are sufficient to distinguish domestic from wild animals.
   Although there is gene flow among domestic and wild species, most of the
   non-synonymous variation in MC1R and ASIP was not observed in wild
   species, presumably because these substitutions and the associated
   colour phenotypes are not effectively transmitted back into wild
   populations. Therefore, this set of substitutions unequivocally
   differentiates wild from domestic animals, which will have important
   practical application in forensic cases involving the poaching of wild
   vicunas and guanacos. These markers will also assist in identifying and
   studying archaeological remains pre- and post-domestication.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has been established as a very
   powerful alternative to traditional extraction methods since its
   introduction in the early 1990s. The heart of the SPME device is an
   expensive thin and very delicate fused-silica fiber, coated with a thin
   polymer film. When extracted, the fiber may bend and break. Due to the
   fragility of the SPME fiber, a fiber protector device is proposed. The
   protector is easily assembled on the SPME device and can easily be
   removed by unscrewing for sampling to the injector. The SPME with the
   fiber protector was tested by headspace-SPME (HS-SPME) gasoline and
   diesel fuel vapor analyses. The results of the extractions with the SPME
   protector were compared with the results of the extractions by SPME
   without the protector. An enhancement to the lighter hydrocarbons was
   observed in the results with the protector but the method sensitivity
   was not altered. The SPME protector was easily cleaned from contaminant
   residues by ethyl acetate washings. The protector can be used for years
   and the fibers remain intact for hundreds of samplings. (c) 2018

Abstract = {{The ability of extraction and preconcentration of small amounts of
   substances from biological samples is important in forensic medicine. In
   the present study, we produced a new solid-phase microextraction fiber
   based on carbon nanotube (CNTs) for extraction and preconcentration of
   small amount of morphine in urine sample. Raw nanofibers were first
   carboxylated with H2SO4/HNO3 (3:1) and then functionalized with
   ethylenediamine. Functionalization was confirmed by FTIR and Raman
   spectroscopy as well as SEM analysis. The functionalized CNTs were
   coated on a porous polypropylene hollow fiber. A new electrical device
   was designed and manufactured for adsorption-desorption of the analyte,
   in which the voltage could be reversed and the analytes could desorb
   into the washing solution for HPLC analysis. The results showed that the
   prepared fiber could adsorb a very low concentration of morphine
   (0.5ppb) in urine matrix, and was successfully used for up to 50 times
   with no significant loss in the extraction efficiency. Recovery of the
   fiber was 77\% at 0.5ppb. The optimum condition for the fiber was 2min
   at 1V of the manufactured electrical catalyst controller. This fiber can
   be used for the detection of a small amount of morphine in biological
   samples, which are not detectable by conventional methods. Simple
   mechanism of this fiber in preconcentrating morphine makes it a novel
   candidate for detection of other opiates and drugs of abuses in crime
   scene investigations and postmortem examinations several days after
   exposure. The prepared electric microextraction device could also
   efficiently concentrate the morphine in the urine matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Inkjet printers are ubiquitous devices in our society. Therefore, it is
   not surprising that they are used to commit different types of illicit
   activities such as threats or extortions by means of anonymous letters,
   frauds in the context of disputed contracts, alterations to or
   counterfeit of ID documents, or counterfeit of currency banknotes. This
   latter application is of primary interest in this study, where a method
   to rapidly develop investigative leads is required. Inkjet printed
   documents produce microscopic colored dots that can be detected using a
   microscopical approach in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy. The
   overall goal of this project is to investigate if Raman data gathered
   from the three cyan, magenta, and yellow microscopic colored dots
   constitute, in conjunction, a chemical signature of sufficient
   discriminating quality to provide reliable investigative leads in a
   time-effective and nondestructive manner. In the present phase of this
   study, the criteria necessary to achieve discriminations between inkjet
   printer inks from different manufacturers, the same manufacturers, and
   even the same models have been evaluated on a set of 11 samples.
   Although Raman spectroscopy is already a relatively well-established
   method for the characterization of colorants (both dyes and pigments),
   this study demonstrates that the contribution of minor peaks within
   Raman spectra improves the discriminating capabilities of the technique.
   The joint consideration of the three colored components was also
   effective in differentiating inkjet printer ink samples, especially
   those from the same manufacturer and in some instances from the same
   model as well.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the need for analyzing cannabis DNA has increased in
   order to accommodate the various types of cannabis samples encountered
   in forensic investigation. This study was aimed to establish a simple
   and accurate cannabis DNA detection system using DNA chromatography. Two
   chromatography chip systems with different features were successfully
   developed. One system (the ``four-line version{''}) involves tetraplex
   PCR amplification, which could be used to detect cannabis DNA and
   distinguish between drug-type and fiber-type cannabis using the
   tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase gene sequence. The other system was
   the ``three-line version{''} with triplex amplification, which was
   specialized to distinguish cannabis from other plants, and had a
   sensitivity (10 fg DNA/reaction) that was 100 times greater than the
   four-line version. In both versions, no false positives were observed
   for 60 medicinal plants, and accurate detection could be performed for
   several simulated forensic samples such as cannabis leaves, buds, stems,
   roots, seeds, resin, and cannabis leaves blended 1/100 in tobacco.
   Detection could be performed by the naked eye and only a thermal cycler
   was required for operation. Thus, DNA chromatography systems for
   cannabis detection are expected to contribute to the analysis of
   cannabis DNA in forensic chemistry laboratories without extensive
   equipment. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) occasionally contributes to sudden death,
   and in rare cases, undiagnosed DCM may be encountered during forensic
   autopsy. It is difficult for forensic experts to confirm the cause of
   DCM because only limited examinations can be performed during forensic

   due to DCM transitioned from lymphocytic myocarditis. In case 1, we
   observed biventricular dilation, moderate diffuse lymphocytic
   infiltration, irregular arrangement of myocardial fibers, and fibrosis.
   In case 2, we observed biventricular dilation, mild lymphocytic
   infiltration, and mild diffuse fibrosis. In these two cases, the patient
   was diagnosed with DCM that had transitioned from myocarditis only
   during autopsy but had not been diagnosed earlier owing to the absence
   of abnormalities during medical examination. Both forensic experts and
   clinical doctors should consider the possibility of inapparent
   cardiomyopathy in subjects who have a clinical course similar to the
   abovementioned cases.}},

Abstract = {{The textile industry uses many raw materials (natural and synthetic dyes
   and fibers) and different dyeing techniques that can be considered
   important pollutants with a negative impact on the environment (toxic
   working conditions, discharged wastewater, and contamination). Although
   synthetic dyes are intensively used, offer a wide range of colors and
   hues and properties of adhesion, longevity, and resistance to sunshine
   and chemical processes, and are cost-effective, they have begun to be
   restricted by many textile producers because they are nonbiodegradable
   and have toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic effects that generate some
   imbalances in plant, animal, and human life. Natural dyes of plant and
   animal origin exhibit very good tolerance to washing, rubbing, and light
   and are biodegradable and nontoxic; these properties have led to a call
   for the renewed use of these dyes. Modern analytical techniques
   (solid-phase extraction, spectrophotometry, HPLC, HPTLC, capillary
   electrophoresis) with different spectroscopy (UV-Vis, diode-array
   detection, pulsed amperometric detection) and/or MS/tandem mass
   spectrometry detectors have an important role in the textile industry in
   obtaining essential information about dyeing techniques, material
   origin, historical trade routes of ancient textiles, and environmental
   pollution. For this purpose, isolation, separation, and quantification
   methods of natural and synthetic textile dyes from various matrices
   (ancient and modern fabrics, water, biota, etc.) are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are monitored in numerous fields using
   several commercially-available sampling options. Sorbent-based sampling
   techniques, such as solid-phase microextraction (SPME), provide
   pre-concentration and focusing of VOCs prior to gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. This study investigated the dynamics of
   SPME Arrow, which exhibits an increased sorbent phase volume and
   improved durability compared to traditional SPME fibers. A volatile
   reference mixture (VRM) and saturated alkanes mix (SAM) were used to
   investigate optimal parameters for microbiological VOC profiling in
   combination with GC-MS analysis. Fiber type, extraction time, desorption
   time, carryover, and reproducibility were characterized, in addition to
   a comparison with traditional SPME fibers. The developed method was then
   applied to longitudinal monitoring of Bacillus subtilis cultures, which
   represents a ubiquitous microbe in medical, forensic, and agricultural
   applications. The carbon wide range/polydimethylsiloxane (CWR/PDMS)
   fiber was found to be optimal for the range of expected VOCs in
   microbiological profiling, and a statistically significant increase in
   the majority of VOCs monitored was observed. B. subtilis cultures
   released a total of 25 VOCs of interest, across three different temporal
   trend categories (produced, consumed, and equilibrated). This work will
   assist in providing foundational data for the use of SPME Arrow in
   future microbiological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Current product composition and quality test methods for the paper and
   pulp industry are mainly based on manual ex-situ wet-bench chemistry
   techniques. For example, the standard method for determining the furnish

   relies on the experience and visual acuity of a specially trained
   analyst to determine the individual plant species present and to
   quantify the amount of each constituent fiber type in a sheet of paper.
   Thus, there is a need for a fast, nondestructive analytical technique
   that leverages intrinsic attributes of the analytes.
   In this paper, we demonstrate an application of dielectric spectroscopy
   (DS) as a potential metrology to differentiate between nonwood pulp and
   wood pulp fibers. This in-situ, noncontact and nondestructive assessment
   method has inherent forensic capabilities and is also amiable to quality
   assurance techniques such as gauge capability studies and real-time

Abstract = {{While color is arguably the most important optical property of
   evidential fibers, the actual dyestuffs responsible for its expression
   in them are, in forensic trace evidence examinations, rarely analyzed
   and still less often identified. This is due, primarily, to the
   exceedingly small quantities of dye present in a single fiber as well as
   to the fact that dye identification is a challenging analytical problem,
   even when large quantities are available for analysis. Among the
   practical reasons for this are the wide range of dyestuffs available
   (and the even larger number of trade names), the low total concentration
   of dyes in the finished product, the limited amount of sample typically
   available for analysis in forensic cases, and the complexity of the dye
   mixtures that may exist within a single fiber. Literature on the topic
   of dye analysis is often limited to a specific method, subset of
   dyestuffs, or an approach that is not applicable given the constraints
   of a forensic analysis. Here, we present a generalized approach to dye
   identification that (1) combines several robust analytical methods, (2)
   is broadly applicable to a wide range of dye chemistries, application
   classes, and fiber types, and (3) can be scaled down to forensic
   casework-sized samples. The approach is based on the development of a
   reference collection of 300 commercially relevant textile dyes that have
   been characterized by a variety of microanalytical methods (HPTLC, Raman
   microspectroscopy, infrared microspectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and
   visible microspectrophotometry). Although there is no single approach
   that is applicable to all dyes on every type of fiber, a combination of
   these analytical methods has been applied using a reproducible approach
   that permits the use of reference libraries to constrain the identity of
   and, in many cases, identify the dye (or dyes) present in a textile
   fiber sample.}},

Abstract = {{Violent contact between individuals during a crime can result in body
   fluids becoming trapped under the fingernails of the individuals
   involved. The traces under fingernails represent valuable forensic
   evidence because DNA profiling can indicate from whom the trace
   originated and proteomic methods can be used to determine the type of
   fluid in the trace, thus providing evidence as to the circumstances
   surrounding the crime. Here, we present an initial study of an
   analytical strategy that involves two complementary techniques, direct
   PCR DNA profiling and direct mass spectrometry-based protein biomarker
   detection, for the comprehensive examination of traces of biological
   fluids gathered from underneath fingernails. With regard to protein
   biomarker detection, direct MALDI-ToF MS/MS is very sensitive, allowing
   results to be obtained from biological material present on only a few
   fibres plucked from a microswab used to collect the traces. Human
   cornulin, a protein biomarker for vaginal fluid, could be detected up to
   5 h after it had been deposited under fingernails whereas haemoglobin, a
   biomarker for blood, is somewhat more persistent under fingernails and
   could be detected up to 18 h post-deposition. Bottom-up tandem mass
   spectrometry techniques were used to provide a high level of confidence
   in assigning the identity of protein biomarkers. nLC-ESI-qToF MS/MS
   offered higher levels of confidence and the ability to detect traces
   that had been present under fingernails for longer periods of time, but
   this performance came with the cost of longer analysis time and a more
   laborious sampling approach.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted a lot of attention as effective
   sorbents due to their strong sorption properties and several potential
   applications in many fields. In this work, the acid oxidized multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) was coated onto a stainless steel wire by
   a simple physical adhesion approach to develop solid-phase
   microextraction (SPME) fibers. By combination of the MWCNTs-COOH coated
   fiber-based headspace SPME and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS), the developed method demonstrates a good enhancement factor
   (288-651), low limits of detection (LODs, 0.2-1.3 mu g/L) for
   determination of amphetamine-type stimulant drugs (ATSs) in urine
   samples. The recoveries of the spiked ATSs (5, 50 and 500 mu g/L) were
   in the range of 88-107\%, the calibration curve was linear for
   concentrations of analytes in the range from 0.5 to 1000 mu g/L
   (R=0.963-0.999). Furthermore, single fiber repeatability and
   fiber-to-fiber reproducibility were in the range of 2.3\%-6.2\% (n = 6)
   and 5.7\%-9.8\% (n = 3), respectively. The MWCNTs-COOH coated fiber is
   highly thermally stable and can be used over 150 times. The method was
   successfully applied to the forensic determination of amphetamine (AMP)
   and methamphetamine (MAMP) in human urine samples and satisfactory
   results were achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical method for the determination of trace amounts of volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to the cosmetics industry was
   optimised, validated and employed for the analysis of commercial
   perfumes. The method used a combination of headspace solid phase
   microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS). In addition to fibre type, three different HS-SPME extraction
   conditions were investigated simultaneously, namely incubation time,
   extraction time and extraction temperature, using a central composite
   design in order to determine the optimal conditions for the extraction
   of VOCs of interest. The main figures of merit of the proposed method
   (calibration range, limits of detection and quantification, trueness and
   precision) were evaluated for six different VOCs in both natural and
   synthetic fibres in order to validate it and verify its capability for
   the proposed application. The validated method was applied for the
   analysis of traces of commercial perfumes from fabrics, and the VOCs of
   interest were successfully quantified. This simple, highly sensitive,
   and robust method has the potential to represent a powerful approach for
   forensic reconstructions where perfumes have transferred between
   individuals, such as during assaults and sexual assaults. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {{The knowledge about the type of the body fluid/tissue that contributed
   to a trace can provide contextual insight into crime scene
   reconstruction and connect a suspect or a victim to a crime scene.
   Especially in sexual assault cases, it is important to verify the
   presence of spermatozoa. Victims often tend to clean their
   underwear/bedding after a sexual assault. If they later decide to report
   the crime to the police, in our experience, investigators usually do not
   send laundered items for DNA examination, since they believe that
   analysis after washing is no longer promising. As not only the
   individualization of traces on laundered items could be important in
   court, but also the type of biological material, we compared the
   potential of modular DNA and RNA extraction from the same specimen for
   simultaneous body fluid identification (BFI) and STR profiling of
   laundered items. BFI included the comparison of a broad range of
   conventional approaches, as wells as new molecular mRNA- and miRNA-based
   methods. The examination comprises the assessment of different fabrics
   and washing temperatures and multiple washing steps. Our results
   indicate that although conventional enzymatic and
   immunochromatographical approaches show limitations for BFI of laundered
   stains, the RSID test was sensitive enough to detect seminal fluid in
   80\% of all tested samples.
   Furthermore, the HY-Liter fluorescence analysis successfully detected
   spermatozoa, even in cloths that were washed twice. For the first time,
   it could be shown that a marker set of mRNAs can be applied for the
   identification of seminal fluid stained cotton and synthetic fiber
   fabrics that have been washed at 40 degrees C. Our experiments
   demonstrate that analysis of DNA and RNA of laundered items is feasible,
   giving the possibility to identify the perpetrator as well as the
   biological properties of the same laundered (seminal) stain under
   certain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Previously unreported line patterns visible under ultraviolet light were
   observed on a proportion of plain white A4 printer/copier paper from

   UVLPs were found to repeat through the ream in a predictable way, while
   also changing. It is postulated that the repeating nature of the UVLPs
   is a result of the way that paper is manufactured. This leads to the
   ability to sequence the sheets compared to their original source paper.
   Even in the absence of UVLPs, it is possible to use our observation of
   the manufacturing process to anticipate the order of several sheets of
   paper and conclusively associate them, in some cases, by physically
   fitting their machine cut edges and crossing paper fibers. Such a novel

Abstract = {{Skin and cartilage tissue specimens from 32 male and 13 female corpses

   (r=0.779, p<0.001, n=45). Aspartate D/L rates from skin showed very low
   correlation (r=0.356, p<0.002, n=44). The multilinear regression model
   of both aspartate D/L rates of cartilage and skin tissues in 44 cases

   racemization rate of Aspartate both in the skin and the cartilage

Abstract = {{The bicomponent fibers are a special class of fibers that consolidate
   two polymers in only one fiber in order to explore individual properties
   of each polymer and can be designed in a spatial configuration that

   process monitoring, quality control and forensic investigation. The
   sheath-core bicomponent fiber composed by polyethylene (PE),
   polypropylene (PP) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) was analyzed by Fourier
   transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and other analytical
   methodologies. Results obtained by FT-IR using modern accessories showed
   efficiency to characterize the polymers of sheath (PE) and core (PP),
   moreover these polymers were confirmed by DSC (Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry). The morphology and elemental composition were also studied
   by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and
   colorimetric analysis allowed characterize and quantify the

Abstract = {{Forensic examiners are often exposed to contextual information that can
   bias their conclusions about evidence samples (e.g., fingerprints,
   fibers, tool marks). We tested the recently proposed filled-control
   method for moderating the biasing effects of contextual information for
   forensic comparisons. Borrowing from an analog to eyewitness lineups
   versus showups. the filler-control method embeds a suspect's sample
   among known-innocent samples rather than the standard practice of
   presenting the analyst with only the suspect's sample for comparison.
   Our test of the filler-control method used fingerprints. After brief
   training, 234 participants compared eight sets of fingerprints in which
   suspect prints either matched the crime print or not, the prints were
   high or low in ambiguity, there was or was not contextual information
   suggesting there should be a match, and the suspect print was either
   embedded among filler prints or presented alone. Although the
   filler-control procedure reduced both hits and false alarms, the
   filler-control procedure produced better results overall as measured by
   d' analyses on suspect samples. These findings suggest the
   filler-control procedure should be considered for use in everyday
   forensic examination judgments, particularly when the error rate for a
   technique is unknown, or the risk of contextual bias is obvious, such as
   when examiners are called to make verification decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Textile fiber is a common form of transferable trace evidence at the
   crime scene. Different techniques such as microscopy or spectroscopy are
   currently being used for trace fiber analysis. Dye characterization in
   trace fiber adds an important molecular specificity during the analysis.
   In this study, we performed a direct trace fiber analysis method via dye
   characterization by a novel automated microfluidics device (MFD) dye
   extraction system coupled with a quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass
   spectrometer (MS). The MFD system used an in-house made automated
   procedure which requires only 10 mL of organic solvent for the
   extraction. The total extraction and identification time by the system
   is under 12 min. A variety of sulfonated azo and anthraquinone dyes were
   analyzed from similar to 1 mm length nylon fiber samples. This
   methodology successfully characterized multiple dyes (>= 3 dyes) from a
   single fiber thread. Additionally, it was possible to do dye
   characterization from single fibers with a diameter of similar to 10 mu
   m. The MFD-MS system was used for elemental composition and isotopic
   distribution analysis where MFD-MS/MS was used for structural
   characterization of dyes on fibers. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{We propose two methods as means to counter radiological terrorist acts,
   such as dirty-bomb or silent-source attacks. The first proposal concerns
   a nuclear detection system using the security cameras already installed
   in public spaces. We describe a method to estimate radiation dose from
   the amount of noise in CCD images caused by neutron radiation. Several
   dosimeters subjected to neutron and gamma-ray irradiation (0.1 mSv-1000
   mSv) were imaged by a CCD video camera. We confirmed that the amount of
   noise in the CCD images varied linearly with radiation exposure. We
   propose a warning system to uncover shielded nuclear materials or
   radiation exposure devices. The second proposal is a survey system of
   radiological residue using long scintillation fibers. After a dirty-bomb
   explosion, the first responders need to search for radiological samples
   for subsequent nuclear forensics. We developed a position-sensitive
   detector with 10 m plastic scintillation fibers. The position resolution
   was found to be 50 cm and the dynamic range extended from 0.05 mu Sv/h
   to 300 mu Sv/h. We also were able to perform real-time measurements of
   distributed sources in situ. Stand-off detection using this device helps
   in surveying contaminated areas.}},

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{288}},
Pages = {{169-172}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{When a person is shot, they are generally wearing clothing which will be
   damaged by the perforation of the bullet. There are relatively few
   reports of such textile damage in the literature and the effect of blood
   on the textile damage observed is not reported. The appearance of
   textile damage caused by bullet impacts is further compounded by the
   diverse nature of (i) fabrics used in apparel and (ii) ammunition types.
   In this work, the effect of blood on textile damage due to ballistic
   impact was investigated by the development of a specimen that
   incorporated blood. The specimens were impacted with two types of pistol
   ammunition that are commonly available (i) 9 mm Luger HP (8.03 g;
   Federal Premium (R) Law Enforcement; jacketed hollow-point) and (ii).357
   Magnum (10.24 g; Express (R) Pistol and Revolver; Remington, R357M3,
   flat-nose soft-point). The resulting textile damage was compared to that
   in specimens without a bleeding layer. The interaction of blood with
   textile damage caused by a bullet-impact affected the appearance of the
   textile damage and resulted in the dispersion of the bullet wipe. These
   results are important in the content of evidence examined by a textile
   damage assessor compared to what might be seen in a typical re-creation
   event in a laboratory. The use of a bleeding layer in textile damage
   investigations due to ballistic impact resulted in a more realistic
   scenario. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional flame retardant (FR) application processes for textiles
   involve aqueous processing which is resource-intensive in terms of
   energy and water usage. Recent research using sol-gel and layer-by-layer
   chemistries, while claimed to be based on more environmentally
   sustainable chemistry, still require aqueous media with the continuing
   problem of water management and drying processes being required. This
   paper outlines the initial forensic work to characterise commercially
   produced viscose/flax, cellulosic furnishing fabrics which have had
   conferred upon them durable flame retardant (FR) treatments using a
   novel, patented atmospheric plasma/Ultraviolet (UV) excimer laser
   facility for processing textiles with the formal name Multiplexed Laser
   Surface Enhancement (MLSE) system. This system (MTIX Ltd., Huddersfield,
   UK) is claimed to offer the means of directly bonding of flame retardant
   precursor species to the component fibres introduced either before
   plasma/UV exposure or into the plasma/UV reaction zone itself; thereby
   eliminating a number of wet processing cycles. Nine commercial fabrics,
   pre-impregnated with a semi-durable, proprietary FR finish and subjected
   to the MLSE process have been analysed for their flame retardant
   properties before and after a 40 degrees C 30 min water soak. For one
   fabric, the pre-impregnated fabric was subjected to a normal heat cure
   treatment which conferred the same level of durability as the
   plasma/UV-treated analogue. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and
   limiting oxygen index (LOI) were used to further characterise their
   burning behaviour and the effect of the treatment on surface fibre
   morphologies were assessed. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that
   negligible changes had occurred to surface topography of the viscose
   fibres occurred during plasma/UV excimer processing.}},

Abstract = {{Herein we propose a successive double injection in
   microstructured-capillary electrophoresis for a fast, simple and
   easy-to-interpret comparison of samples. First, injection was optimized
   through three capillaries (conventional capillary of 28.5 mu m id,
   microstructured capillary (MSC) of 6 holes of 32.8 pm each, and MSC of
   61 holes of 8.9 mu m each). The 6-hole MSC was selected, as it provided
   reproducible results, and higher volume capacity, which allowed larger
   injection volumes. Then, the method was applied to the analysis of
   different types of inks present in questioned documents. After the
   criterion to establish a MATCH or No match between two successive
   samples, a blind test with 20 pairwise comparisons between questioned
   signatures was finally made to demonstrate the potential of the method.
   The method proved to be useful in pairwise comparison analyses, as it:
   i) provides a fast and practical analysis; ii) maintains the same CE
   conditions for both samples; iii) uses simple data treatment which puts
   on easy interpretation on the results, interesting in court. (C) 2018

   a spectral database and evaluative comparison strategy}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{287}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In numerous major crime cases undertaken at our laboratory the recovery
   of large numbers of fibres (>1000), particularly in cases with no known
   source, presented several challenges. These included the inability to
   effectively manage the data (i.e. combination of MSP spectra,
   microscopic characteristics, composition, etc.) and perform comparisons
   in an efficient manner. To address these challenges, and in response to
   a growing need for performing fibre comparisons, we developed a database
   of textile fibre microspectrophotometric (MSP) spectra. The database,
   designed to compare MSP spectra using a modified Pearson method of
   correlation, currently contains over 20,000 normalised and first
   derivative spectra of casework, validation and reference textile fibres.
   A comparison strategy for cases with a large number of questioned
   samples was devised, involving identification of critical fibres in the
   casework data set, development of preliminary fibre groups classified
   according to their corresponding/similar MSP spectra, and verification
   of the preliminary groups via brightfield and fluorescence comparison
   microscopy. The database has successfully been utilised for proficiency
   trials and casework with small questioned fibre sets. Furthermore, in a
   case involving a larger dataset (>4000 ``unknown{''} fibres) the
   database assisted in the efficient classification of 156 distinct groups
   of interest, highlighting its utility in providing investigative leads
   for the identification of potential sources of the recovered fibres. (c)

Abstract = {{A porcine model of second intention wound healing was established and

   sampled from two wounds between days 2 and 18. By histological
   evaluation the following characteristics were found useful for
   determining the age of wounds: neutrophil: macrophage ratio,
   angiogenesis, hyperplasia of fibroblasts, presence of hemosiderophages
   and granulation tissue. The latter was present from day 4 (n = 8 wounds,
   100\%), but by gross evaluation it was not recognized until day 5 (n = 4
   wounds, 100\%). From day 4 to 10, the thickness of granulation tissue
   increased by 1.2 +/- 2.4 mm/day. The thickness of collagen fibers within

Title = {{The three-dimensional arrangement of the mineralized collagen fibers in
   elephant ivory and its relation to mechanical and optical properties}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{342-351}},

Abstract = {{Elephant tusks are composed of dentin or ivory, a hierarchical and
   composite biological material made of mineralized collagen fibers (MCF).
   The specific arrangement of the MCF is believed to be responsible for
   the optical and mechanical properties of the tusks. Especially the MCF
   organization likely contributes to the formation of the bright and dark
   checkerboard pattern observed on polished sections of tusks (Schreger
   pattern). Yet, the precise structural origin of this optical motif is
   still controversial. We hereby address this issue using complementary
   analytical methods (small and wide angle X-ray scattering,
   cross-polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) on
   elephant ivory samples and show that MCF orientation in ivory varies
   from the outer to the inner part of the tusk. An external cohesive layer
   of MCF with fiber direction perpendicular to the tusk axis wraps the
   mid-dentin region, where the MCF are oriented mainly along the tusk axis
   and arranged in a plywood-like structure with fiber orientations
   oscillating in a narrow angular range. This particular
   oscillating-plywood structure of the MCF and the birefringent properties
   of the collagen fibers, likely contribute to the emergence of the
   Schreger pattern, one of the most intriguing macroscopic optical
   patterns observed in mineralized tissues and of great importance for
   authentication issues in archeology and forensic sciences. (C) 2018 Acta

Journal = {{LEGAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{107-112}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Strangulation of the heart appears to be an exceedingly rare mechanical
   phenomenon that can develop with epicardial pacing wires in individuals
   undergoing somatic growth. Over the passage of time, owing to size
   mismatch between a fixed wire length and dynamically growing heart, the
   epicardial wire may embed around the heart resulting in the progressive
   over-pressurizing of involved cardiac structures. Depending on the
   location of the peak constriction pressures, cardiac strangulation may
   damagingly affect coronary circulation, heart valves function, or
   physiologic filling of the heart chambers, with risk of myocardial
   ischemia, decreased cardiac output, acute cardiac failure, ventricular
   arrhythmias and death. We report a case of a 29-year-old male with
   sudden cardiac death owing to cardiac strangulation with epicardial
   pacing wire that had been retained in place almost 30 years. At autopsy,
   an enlarged and abnormally contoured heart was found to be strangulated
   by an epicardial pacing wire; histopathologic examination confirmed
   hypertrophy of the myocardial fibers, myofiber disarrangement, and
   replacement-type fibrolipomatosis. In addition, this article
   consolidates the available literature on cardiac strangulation by an
   epicardial wire and highlight relevant clinical and medico-legal
   features for the forensic professionals.}},

Journal = {{LEGAL MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Electrical injury is damage caused by an electrical current passing
   through the body. We have previously reported that irregular stripes
   crossing skeletal muscle fibers (python pattern) and multiple small
   nuclei arranged in the longitudinal direction of the muscle fibers
   (chained nuclear change) are uniquely observed by histopathological
   analysis in the skeletal muscle tissues of patients with electrical
   injury. However, it remains unclear whether these phenomena'are caused
   by the electrical current itself or by the joule heat generated by the
   electric current passing through the body. To clarify the causes
   underlying these changes, we applied electric and heat injury to the
   exteriorized rat soleus muscle in situ. Although both the python pattern
   and chained nuclear change were induced by electric injury, only the
   python pattern was induced by heat injury. Furthermore, a chained
   nuclear change was induced in the soleus muscle cells by electric
   current flow in physiological saline at 40 degrees C ex vivo, but a
   python pattern was not observed. When the skeletal muscle was exposed to
   electrical injury in cardiac-arrested rats, a python pattern was induced
   within 5 h after cardiac arrest, but no chained nuclear change was
   observed. Therefore, a chained nuclear change is induced by an
   electrical current alone in tissues in vital condition, whereas a python
   pattern is caused by joule heat, which may occur shortly after death.
   The degree and distribution of these skeletal muscle changes may be
   useful histological markers for analyzing cases of electrical injury in
   forensic medicine.}},

Abstract = {{In the forensic comparison of dyed fibers, thin-layer chromatography
   (TLC) is one of the few analytical techniques that have proven sensitive
   enough to detect and separate the minute quantities of dyestuffs present
   in single fibers. The method has become well-established by trace
   evidence examiners as a means of further distinguishing fibers whose
   colors appear to be the same by both comparison microscopy and
   microspectrophotometry. As practiced at present, the forensic analysis
   of dyes is limited to a comparison of the separated dye bands from known
   and questioned fibers performed on the same TLC plate. It is recognized,
   however, that retardation factor (R-f) alone is not sufficient proof of
   identify. The limited use of investigative TLC analysis in forensic
   fiber examinations is due in part to the range of uncontrolled or poorly
   defined variables that affect the reproducibility of the developed
   plate. Through the study of a six component test dye mixture developed
   on over 50 high-performance thin-layer chromatography plates, the
   effects of several critical variables that affect reproducibility and
   resolution, including: plate selection, pre-elution, tank saturation,
   developing distance, and eluent stability have been evaluated.
   When considered collectively, the results of this research provide a
   means for acquiring and archiving repeatable data, both from casework
   and known reference samples collected on different plates and at
   different times. These provide a pathway for the development and
   utilization of reference databases for the identification of dyes. The
   empirical uncertainty established for the generalized separation
   procedure used in this research provides objective guidance for
   evaluating the significance of associations (or eliminations) made on
   the basis Rf. Ultimately, this research also opens a pathway to the use
   of forensic dye analysis as an investigative tool, rather than one
   exclusively restricted to comparative analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Here, we propose a novel method of determining the friction coefficient
   of intact free liquid jets moving in quiescent air. The middle-size jets
   of this kind are relevant for such applications as decorative fountains,
   fiber-forming, fire suppression, agriculture, and forensics. The present
   method is based on measurements of trajectories created using a
   straightforward experimental apparatus emulating such jets at a variety
   of initial inclination angles. Then, the trajectories are described
   theoretically, accounting for the longitudinal traction imposed on such
   jets by the surrounding air. The comparison of the experimental data
   with the theoretical predictions shows that the results can be perfectly
   superimposed with the friction coefficient C-fd = 5Re(d)(-1/2 +/- 0.05),
   in the 621 <= Re-d <= 1289 range, with Re-d being the Reynolds number
   based on the local cross-sectional diameter of the jet. The results also
   show that the farthest distance such jets can reach corresponds to the
   initial inclination angle alpha = 35 degrees which is in agreement with
   already published data.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, an increasing number of stimulant drugs and new
   psychoactive substances (NPSs) have caused concern in scientific
   communities and therefore innovative methods to extract compounds from
   complex biological samples are required. This work is aimed at
   developing and validating a clean, convenient and straightforward
   extraction procedure with microliter amounts of organic solvent using
   Solid Phase Micro-Extraction tips (SPME tips) and analysis using Gas
   Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) in human urine samples. Another
   aim is to evaluate three different types of SPME fibre tips C18, C18-SCX
   (mixed mode) and PDMS-DVB. The quantification method examined the
   different classes of stimulant compounds included Amphetamine-Type
   Stimulants (ATSs) (amphetamine, methamphetamine, para-methoxyamphetamine
   (PMA), and (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)) and synthetic
   cathinones (mephedrone, buphedrine (buphedrone ephedrine metabolite),
   4-methylephedrine (mephedrone metabolite), and pentylone). The method
   was developed with respect to several areas of the experimental design
   including pH, ionic strength, addition of salts, vial dimensions,
   analytes and derivatisation, type of solvents, solvent volume,
   extraction and desorption time, agitation speeds in the extraction and
   desorption steps and matrix volume. The optimised method was validated
   for eight compounds using the SPME PDMS/DVB fibre tips with satisfactory
   linearity and selectivity ranging between 50 and 2000 ng mL(-1), and
   limits of detection (LODs) and low limits of quantification (LLOQs)
   ranging between (5-25) and (25-100) ng mL(-1) respectively. Within-run
   and between-run accuracy and precision were <15\%. The method was
   applied to real human urine samples indicating its suitability for
   common stimulant drugs and provided clean chromatograms with no
   interfering peaks. The assessment of green analytical chemistry for the
   method used was discussed and compared with Solid Phase Extraction
   (SPE). According to the results obtained we recommend the method for use
   in routine laboratories carrying out drug/forensic analysis for
   confirmation tests of the studied compounds.}},

Title = {{Pathology of carbon monoxide poisoning in two cats}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Carbon monoxide (CO), a common cause of poisoning in human
   beings has also been implicated in the death of animals. Though there
   are multiple studies on CO poisoning and relevant lethal blood COHb
   concentrations in humans, there are no reliable reports of diagnostic
   lethal carboxyhemoglobin percentage of saturation (COHb\%) in cats.
   Additionally, due to shared housing environments, exposures to companion
   animals can be a surrogate for lethal exposures in human beings and
   provide valuable information in concurrent forensic investigations.
   Case presentation: Two adult Singapura brown ticked cats were submitted
   to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory (CAHFS) for
   necropsy and diagnostic work-up. These animals were found dead along
   with their two deceased owners. Similar lesions were observed in both
   cats. At necropsy, gross lesions consisted of multifocal, large,
   irregular, bright red spots on the skin of the abdomen and the inner
   surface of ear pinnae, bright red muscles and blood. The carcasses, and
   tissues fixed in formalin retained the bright red discoloration for up
   to two weeks. Microscopic lesions included diffuse pulmonary congestion
   and edema, and multifocal intense basophilia of cardiomyocytes mostly
   affecting whole fibers or occasionally a portion of the fiber. Based on
   the clinical history, gross and microscopic changes, cyanide or carbon
   monoxide poisoning was suspected. Blood samples analyzed for carbon
   monoxide showed 57 and 41\% carboxyhemoglobin COHb\%. Muscle samples
   were negative for cyanide.
   Conclusion: There are no established reference values for lethal COHb
   concentration in cats. The COHb\% values detected in this case which
   fell within the lethal range reported for other species, along with the
   gross lesions and unique histological findings in the heart suggest a
   helpful criteria for diagnosis of CO intoxication associated death in
   cats. This case demonstrates that since pets share the same environment
   as human beings and often are a part of their activities, they can be
   useful adjuncts in potential forensic investigations to help solve human
   cases.}},

Title = {{Post-mortem diffusion MRI of the cervical spine and its nerve roots}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FORENSIC RADIOLOGY AND IMAGING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{50-56}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this work is to examine the architectural
   configuration and the microstructural substrate of the cervical spine
   and its nerve roots with post-mortem (PM) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   in non-fixed subjects and to compare these findings with histology.
   Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired on a 1.5 T
   MRI scanner in five non-fixed non-trauma deaths. Two different areas
   were evaluated: 1) the cervical spinal cord and ventral and dorsal nerve
   roots with a ``high in-plane{''} DTI and a multi-echo fast field echo
   protocol, and 2) the cervical peripheral nerves with an ``isotropic{''}
   DTI and a 3D turbo spin echo protocol. Histology samples were obtained
   matching the anatomical level of the slices of the `high in-plane' DTI
   protocol.
   Results: We were able to show detailed reconstructions of the dorsal and
   ventral nerve roots with the `high inplane' protocol and identified a
   low fractional anisotropy (FA = 0.30 +/- 0.08) in the grey matter and a
   high FA (0.51 +/- 0.13) in the white matter. Both grey and white matter
   configurations correlated with the anatomical MRI, the diffusion MRI,
   and with the histological sections. Using the `isotropic' DTI protocol,
   it was feasible to reconstruct the spinal cord, cervical nerves, and
   nerve roots in all PM subjects.
   Conclusion: We were able to generate detailed architectural
   configurations of the ventral and dorsal nerve roots. Anatomical and
   diffusion MR scans showed good qualitative agreement with histology. We
   believe that PMDTI will be helpful in the assessment of head and neck
   injuries in a forensic setting.}},

Journal = {{LEGAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{59-65}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Evaluation of two suicidal helium inhalation cases is presented,
   comprising both conventional autopsy methods and postmortem computed
   tomography. Conventional postmortem examinations reveal no
   characteristic changes. Modern diagnostic techniques enabled to disclose
   the presence of a very large amount of accumulated gas in all examined
   areas, including veins and arteries of the head, torso, lower
   extremities, heart chambers, and between muscle fibers in both cases.
   The changes due to possible putrefaction were taken into consideration -
   radiological alteration index was calculated. In forensic literature,
   the reported mechanism of death in helium poisoning is rapid
   asphyxiation due to oxygen deprivation. However, papers on clinical
   cases and animal studies with the use of helium report development of
   gas in body cavities and lethal gas embolism, comprehensible when we
   take into account the specific physical properties of helium: high
   permeability and very low solubility in blood. The results reported by
   the authors are consistent with massive gas embolism similar to changes
   presented in cases of decompression illness. They suggest this as the
   cause of death in helium inhalation cases. Undoubtedly, this requires
   confirmation in further observations, taking into account
   differentiating diagnosis of air embolism versus oxygen deprivation.}},

   Western world and tend not to be as popular a weapon as firearms or
   knives. Yet there are still injuries and fatalities caused by these
   low-velocity weapons due to their availability to the public and that a
   licence is not required to own them. This study aimed to highlight the
   penetration capabilities of aluminium arrows into soft tissue and bones
   in the presence of clothing. Further from that, how the type and fit of
   clothing as well as arrowhead type contribute to penetration capacity.
   In this study ballistic gelatine blocks (non -clothed and loose fit or
   tight fit clothed) were shot using a 24 lb weight draw recurve bow and
   aluminium arrows accompanied by four different arrowheads (bullet, judo,
   blunt and broadhead).
   The penetration capability of aluminium arrows was examined, and the
   depth of penetration was found to be dependent on the type of arrowhead
   used as well as by the type and fit or lack thereof of the clothing
   covering the block. Loose fit clothing reduced penetration with half of
   the samples, reducing penetration capacity by percentages between 0\%
   and 98.33\%, at a range of 10 m. While the remaining half of the samples
   covered with tight clothing led to reductions in penetration of between
   14.06\% and 94.12\%.
   The damage to the clothing and the gelatine (puncturing, cutting and
   tearing) was affected by the shape of the arrowhead, with the least
   damaged caused by the blunt arrowheads and the most by the broadhead
   arrows. Clothing fibres were also at times found within the projectile
   tract within the gelatine showing potential for subsequent infection of
   an individual with an arrow wound.
   Ribs, femur bones and spinal columns encased in some of the gelatine
   blocks all showed varying levels of damage, with the most and obvious
   damage being exhibited by the ribs and spinal column.
   The information gleaned from the damage to clothing, gelatine blocks and
   bones could potentially be useful for forensic investigators, for
   example, when a body has been discovered with no weapons or gunshot
   residue present.}},

Title = {{Diagnosis of electrocution: The application of scanning electron
   microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in five cases}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Deaths from electricity, generally, do not have specific
   findings at the autopsy. The diagnosis is commonly based on the
   circumstances of the death and the morphologic findings, above all the
   current mark. Yet, the skin injury due to an electrocution and other
   kinds of thermal injuries often cannot be differentiated with certainty.
   Therefore, there is a great interest in finding specific markers of
   electrocution. The search for the metallization of the skin through
   Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with Energy Dispersive X-Ray
   Spectroscopy (EDS) probe is of special importance in order to achieve a
   definite diagnosis in case of suspected electrocution.
   Materials and methods: We selected five cases in which the electrocution
   was extremely likely considering the circumstances of the death. In each
   case a forensic autopsy was performed. Then, the skin specimens were
   stained with Hematoxylin Eosin and Perls. On the other hand, the skin
   lesions were examined with a scanning electron microscope equipped with
   EDS probe in order to evaluate the morphological ultrastructural
   features and the presence of deposits on the surface of the skin.
   Results: The typical skin injury of the electrocution (current mark)
   were macroscopically detected in all of the cases. The microscopic
   examination of the skin lesions revealed the typical spherical vacuoles
   in the horny layer and, in the epidermis, the elongation of the cell
   nuclei as well as necrosis. Perls staining was negative in 4 out 6
   cases.
   Ultrastructural morphology revealed the evident vacuolization of the
   horny layer, elongation of epidermic cells, coagulation of the elastic
   fibers.
   EDS-microanalysis: In the specimens collected from the site of contact
   with the conductor of case 1 and 2, the presence of the K alpha peaks of
   iron was detected. In the corresponding specimens taken from cases 2, 4,
   5 the microanalysis showed the K alpha peaks of titanium. In case 3,
   titanium and carbon were found.
   Conclusions: In the suspicion of electrocution, the integrated use of
   different tools is recommended, including macroscopic observation, H\&E
   staining, iron-specific staining, scanning electron microscopy and EDS
   microanalysis. Only the careful interpretation of the results provided
   by all these methods can allow the pathologist to correctly identify the
   cause of the death. Particularly, the present study suggests that the
   microanalysis (SEM-EDS) represents a very useful tool for the diagnosis
   of electrocution, allowing the detection and the identification of the
   metals embedded in the skin and their evaluation in the context of the
   ultrastructural morphology. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive literature review and new post-irradiation experimental
   results are presented of genotyping blood stains and hair, and physical
   examinations of latent fingerprints, hairs, and fibers. Results indicate
   that successful development of nuclear short tandem repeat (STR) and
   mitochondrial DNA sequence profiles from human blood and hair evidence
   is possible-up to a point-following exposure to gamma, neutron, beta,
   and alpha radiation at several levels that would most likely be present
   at this type of crime scene (i.e., a ``dirty bomb,{''} etc.). Commencing
   at gamma radiation levels between 90 and 900 kGy, DNA analysis using
   conventional DNA techniques was unsuccessful. In general, irradiation
   negatively affected the quality of latent fingerprints. All four
   radiation types degraded most fingerprint samples at all doses;
   nevertheless, many fingerprints remained of value for potential use in
   comparison. Although variable from one hair to another, microscopic
   changes observed for all types and levels of irradiation could
   potentially result in false exclusions. Negligible microscopic changes
   were observed in papers and fibers (used as substrates for fingerprints
   and bloodstains) up to 90 kGy gamma, but fluorescence of fibers began to
   change above that dose. Paper and fibers, as well as plastic evidence
   enclosures, became extremely brittle leading to breakage after a gamma
   dose of 900 kGy. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Frequency of Microplastics in Mesopelagic Fishes from the Northwest
   Atlantic}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{Microplastics are a ubiquitous pollutant in our seas today and are known
   to have detrimental effects on a variety of organisms. Over the past
   decade numerous studies have documented microplastic ingestion by marine
   species with more recent investigations focussing on the secondary
   impacts of microplastic ingestion on ecosystem processes. However, few
   studies so far have examined microplastic ingestion by mesopelagic fish
   which are one of the most abundant pelagic groups in our oceans and
   through their vertical migrations are known to contribute significantly
   to the rapid transport of carbon and nutrients to the deep sea.
   Therefore, any ingestion of microplastics by mesopelagic fish may
   adversely affect this cycling and may aid in transport of microplastics
   from surface waters to the deep-sea benthos. In this study microplastics
   were extracted from mesopelagic fish under forensic conditions and
   analysed for polymer type utilising micro-Fourier Transform Infrared
   Spectroscopy (micro-FTIR) analysis. Fish specimens were collected from
   depth (300-600 m) in a warm-core eddy located in the Northwest Atlantic,
   1,200 km due east of Newfoundland during April and May 2015. In total,
   233 fish gut contents from seven different species of mesopelagic fish
   were examined. An alkaline dissolution of organic materials from
   extracted stomach contents was performed and the solution filtered over
   a 0.7 mu m borosilicate filter. Filters were examined for microplastics
   and a subsample originating from 35 fish was further analysed for
   polymer type through micro-FTIR analysis. Seventy-three percent of all
   fish contained plastics in their gut contents with Gonostoma denudatum
   having the highest ingestion rate (100\%) followed by Serrivomer beanii
   (93\%) and Lampanyctus macdonaldi (75\%). Overall, we found a much
   higher occurrence of microplastic fragments, mainly polyethylene fibres,
   in the gut contents of mesopelagic fish than previously reported.
   Stomach fullness, species and the depth at which fish were caught at,
   were found to have no effect on the amount of microplastics found in the
   gut contents. However, these plastics were similar to those sampled from
   the surface water. Additionally, using forensic techniques we were able
   to highlight that fibres are a real concern rather than an artefact of
   airborne contamination.}},

Title = {{Assessment of Ductile, Brittle, and Fatigue Fractures of Metals Using
   Optical Coherence Tomography}},
Journal = {{METALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Some forensic in situ investigations, such as those needed in
   transportation (for aviation, maritime, road, or rail accidents) or for
   parts working under harsh conditions (e.g., pipes or turbines) would
   benefit from a method/technique that distinguishes ductile from brittle
   fractures of metalsas material defects are one of the potential causes
   of incidents. Nowadays, the gold standard in material studies is
   represented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, SEM
   instruments are large, expensive, time-consuming, and lab-based; hence,
   in situ measurements are impossible. To tackle these issues, we propose
   as an alternative, lower-cost, sufficiently high-resolution technique,
   Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to perform fracture analysis by
   obtaining the topography of metallic surfaces. Several metals have been
   considered in this study: low soft carbon steels, lamellar graphite cast
   iron, an antifriction alloy, high-quality rolled steel, stainless steel,
   and ductile cast iron. An in-house developed Swept Source (SS) OCT
   system, Master-Slave (MS) enhanced is used, and height profiles of the
   samples' surfaces were generated. Two configurations were used: one
   where the dimension of the voxel was 1000 mu m(3) and a second one of
   160 mu m(3)with a 10 m and a 4 m transversal resolution, respectively.
   These height profiles allowed for concluding that the carbon steel
   samples were subject to ductile fracture, while the cast iron and
   antifriction alloy samples were subjected to brittle fracture. The
   validation of OCT images has been made with SEM images obtained with a 4
   nm resolution. Although the OCT images are of a much lower resolution
   than the SEM ones, we demonstrate that they are sufficiently good to
   obtain clear images of the grains of the metallic materials and thus to
   distinguish between ductile and brittle fractures-especially with the
   higher resolution MS/SS-OCT system. The investigation is finally
   extended to the most useful case of fatigue fracture of metals, and we
   demonstrate that OCT is able to replace SEM for such investigations as
   well.}},

Abstract = {{Paper under the microscopic view has a rough surface formed by
   intertwisted wood fibers. Such roughness is unique on a specific
   location of the paper and is almost impossible to duplicate. Previous
   work has shown that commodity scanners and cameras are capable of
   capturing such intrinsic roughness in term of surface normal vectors for
   security and forensics applications. In this paper, we examine several
   candidate mathematical models for camera captured images of paper
   surfaces and compare the modeling accuracies with reference to the
   measurement by the confocal microscopy. Experimental results show that
   the model with distinct intensity bias for images captured from
   different viewpoints can provide the closest result to the confocal
   measurement. We discover that high-frequency subbands of reconstructed
   3D surfaces are more powerful than the norm map in describing the
   uniqueness of a physical surface. We show through a practical paper
   surface based authentication system that incorporating these findings
   can improve the discrimination performance.}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy has emerged as a valuable instrumental tool to
   supplement spectroscopic approaches, such as infrared spectroscopy for
   analyzing forensic samples including drugs, fibers, textiles, soil
   components, inks, pigments, paints, and body fluids, both in the field
   and at crime laboratories. As a result, Raman spectroscopy has been
   incorporated into undergraduate forensic chemistry courses. Using a
   Rigaku Progeny X2 Raman spectrometer, students recorded Raman spectra of
   organic and inorganic materials including drugs, adulterants, explosives
   precursors, dyes, pigments, and coordination complexes. Students
   searched for matches using a chemical library and assigned peaks
   attributable to the chemical structures using a correlation table. They
   observed conditions in which Raman spectroscopy recorded bands not
   observed with the infrared spectrometer, reflecting the complementarity
   of the two techniques. An advantage of Raman spectroscopy for forensic
   analysis compared to infrared spectroscopy is that dangerous samples can
   be analyzed through containers and aqueous solutions can be analyzed
   without interference from water.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of trace amounts of drugs of abuse is important in a variety of
   situations, including forensic casework. Here, a method for the facile,
   rapid collection of traces of drugs from a variety of porous and
   nonporous surfaces, including fabrics, is detailed. A small amount of
   extraction solvent, including an internal standard, is applied to the
   fabric surface, followed by application of a patterned absorbent disk
   which resorbs much of the extraction solvent along with dissolved traces
   of any drug present. Over half of the extraction solvent is recovered in
   15 s from many natural and synthetic fabrics, with weights ranging from
   64 to 374 mg/in.(2), by pressing a half-inch diameter patterned glass
   fiber membrane disk to the wetted area. The patterned disk is then
   placed in a standard OpenSpot (TM) holder of a direct analysis in real
   time (DART) mass spectrometer with a data collection time of 1 or 2 min.
   Semi-quantitation of low microgram levels of drugs is achieved by
   comparison of spectra to those from a standard control disk.}},

Title = {{Diagnosis of sudden cardiac death due to early myocardial ischemia: An

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{117-125}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this post-mortem ultrastructural and immunohistochemical
   study is to explore the characteristics of acute myocardial ischemia in
   the context of sudden death, using the combination of two different
   methods, both more insightful than ordinary histology. Transmission
   electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry, in addition to the
   traditional histology, were applied to study human heart specimens
   collected during forensic autopsies. The whole series was sub-grouped
   into cases (n=17) and controls (N=10). The control group consisted of
   unnatural death with a short agonal period (immediately lethal
   injuries). Heart samples of the two cohorts of subjects were prepared
   for electron microscopy. On the other hand, each specimen, formalin
   fixed and paraffin embedded, was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and
   immunoreacted with the following primary antibodies: anti-Fibronectin,
   anti-Connexin-43, anti-npCx43 (dephosphorylated form of Connexin43),
   anti-Zonula occludens-1. Immunopositivity for each marker in the
   myocardium was semi-quantitatively graded. Electron microscopy revealed
   a number of interesting differ-ences, statistically significant, between
   acute myocardial ischemia and controls, regarding the morphology of
   nucleus, mitochondria and intercellular junctions. By
   immunohistochemistry, fibronectin was found to be increased in the
   extracellular matrix of the acute myocardial ischemia cases, with a
   statistically significant difference compared to the controls. Connexin
   43 staining disclosed a slight increase (not statistically significant)
   in the cytoplasm of acute myocardial ischemia cases compared to the
   controls, whereas no significant differences were seen between cases and
   controls at intercellular junctions. npCx43 showed an evident difference
   of intensity and pattern (even though not statistically significant) in
   cases compared to controls and overall this difference was more evident
   in the cytoplasm. Zonula occludens 1, described as an important marker
   for functional modification of cardiac muscle fibers, resulted negative
   or very weak in the vast majority of both cases and controls. The
   present study attempts to simultaneously apply electron microscopy and
   immunohistochemistry, in order to figure out the morphological changes
   that might lead to pathological processes underlying the sudden,
   unexpected death due to acute myocardial ischemia, and consequently to
   find useful diagnostic markers of very early ischemic injury. Both
   methods showed significant differences between acute myocardial ischemia
   and controls, regarding, overall nuclei, mitochondria, and intercellular
   junctions.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that nylon flocked swabs outperform
   traditional fiber swabs in DNA recovery due to their innovative design
   and lack of internal absorbent core to entrap cellular materials. The
   microFLOQ (R) Direct swab, a miniaturized version of the 4N6 FLOQSwab
   (R), has a small swab head that is treated with a lysing agent which
   allows for direct amplification and DNA profiling from sample collection
   to final result in less than two hours. Additionally, the microFLOQ (R)
   system subsamples only a minute portion of a stain and preserves the
   vast majority of the sample for subsequent testing or re-analysis, if
   desired. The efficacy of direct amplification of DNA from dilute
   bloodstains, saliva stains, and touch samples was evaluated using
   microFLOQ (R) Direct swabs and the GlobalFiler (TM) Express system.
   Comparisons were made to traditional methods to assess the robustness of
   this alternate workflow. Controlled studies with 1:19 and 1:99 dilutions
   of bloodstains and saliva stains consistently yielded higher STR peak
   heights than standard methods with 1 ng input DNA from the same samples.
   Touch samples from common items yielded single source and mixed profiles
   that were consistent with primary users of the objects. With this novel
   methodology/workflow, no sample loss occurs and therefore more template
   DNA is available during amplification. This approach may have important
   implications for analysis of low quantity and/or degraded samples that
   plague forensic casework.}},

Title = {{Expression of Wnt/beta-catenin related genes after skeletal muscle
   contusion}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{704-711}},
Abstract = {{Background: It was aimed to determine expressions of genes related to
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling for evaluating time duration after skeletal
   muscle contusion. Methods: Pathological change of skeletal muscle was
   observed after H-E staining. mRNA of respective genes was quantified
   with real-time quantitative PCR. Expression of beta-catenin was further
   characterized with immunostaining and quantified as intensity/area and
   further immune blotting and quantified as grey intensity normalized to
   loading control (GADPH). Results: After injury, skeletal muscle
   exhibited prominent inflammatory response, hyperplasia and regeneration.
   Infiltration of inflammatory cell, formation of myotube and maturation
   of skeletal muscle fiber were observed under HE staining. Expression of
   FZD4, Myo D, Myf5 changed during early stages after injury and could
   serve to evaluate injury within 24 h; Expression of SFRP5 and Fra1
   changed during early-to-intermediate stages after injury and could serve
   to evaluate injury within 12-48 h; Expression of MRF4 changed during
   intermediate stages after injury and could serve to evaluate injury
   within 36-48 h; Expression of beta-catenin changed during intermediate
   stages after injury and could serve to evaluate injury within 36 h-3 d;
   Expression of MyoG changed during late stages after injury and could
   serve to evaluate injury within 48 h-7 d. Immunostaining experiments
   showed that 36 h after injury, membrane beta-catenin decreased while
   nucleus beta-catenin increased. Conclusion: Wnt/beta-catenin related
   genes are involved in regeneration of skeletal muscle after contusion.
   The sequential changes of gene expression can be used for evaluating the
   duration after contusion.}},

Abstract = {{Body fluids like blood and saliva are commonly encountered during
   investigations of high volume crimes like homicides. The identification
   of the cellular origin and the composition of the trace can link
   suspects or victims to a certain crime scene and provide a probative
   value for criminal investigations. To erase all traces from the crime
   scene, perpetrators often wash away their traces. Characteristically,
   items that show exposed stains like blood are commonly cleaned or
   laundered to free them from potential visible leftovers. Mostly,
   investigators do not delegate the DNA analysis of laundered items.
   However, some studies have already revealed that items can still be used
   for DNA analysis even after they have been laundered. Nonetheless, a
   systematical evaluation of laundered blood and saliva traces that
   provides a comparison of different established and newly developed
   methods for body fluid identification (BFI) is still missing. Herein, we
   present the results of a comprehensive study of laundered blood- and
   saliva-stained pieces of cloths that were applied to a broad range of
   methods for BFI including conventional approaches as well as molecular
   mRNA profiling. The study included the evaluation of cellular origin as
   well as DNA profiling of blood- and saliva-stained (synthetic fiber and
   cotton) pieces of cloths, which have been washed at various washing
   temperatures for one or multiple times. Our experiments demonstrate
   that, while STR profiling seems to be sufficiently sensitive for the
   individualization of laundered items, there is a lack of approaches for
   BFI with the same sensitivity and specificity allowing to characterize
   the cellular origin of challenging, particularly laundered, blood and
   saliva samples.}},

Abstract = {{The question at the centre of forensic expertise is the determination of
   the probative value of a correspondence between recovered trace evidence
   and suspect material. In the field of textile fibers, it is necessary to
   decide on the meaning of non-differentiation between a textile in
   question and a reference group (of control) fibres from a putative
   source. To do this, it is possible to use a probabilistic approach, in
   particular a Bayesian approach, in order to assign a likelihood ratio to
   the observations resulting from laboratory examinations. Several
   parameters have to be considered: the rarity of the observed fibres
   (occurrence), the probability that the latter will come from the
   criminal action (transfer and persistence) and the probability that they
   are present by chance (not related to the criminal activity). The
   present article is a critical review of the sources of information
   published in the forensic literature that can be used to estimate the
   parameters for the calculation of the likelihood ratio. The main results
   are presented and are discussed in the light of the advantages and
   limitations of different types of studies. In this first part, only the
   studies dedicated to the determination of the scarcity of the index
   fibres (occurrence) and the `background' fibres will be presented. Work
   on the transfer, persistence and recovery of fibres will be dealt with
   in Part Two.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of
   automating fiber analysis in forensic science applications. In order to
   make self-directed collection of spectral data possible the number of
   measuring locations needs to be restricted to fibers only. Full scans of
   the samples would result in very large amounts of data of which only a
   small part carries actual information about the objects of interest.
   Images obtained by optical microscopes are used for preprocessing to
   find suitable candidates for measuring locations that subsequently may
   be used to control the microscope stage for spectroscopic measurements.
   This paper presents a method based on a nonlinear transform known to
   enhance the contrast in a way that makes segmentation on grayscale
   images possible. It further introduces an approach using the differences
   between the color channels of RGB images combined with common
   morphological operators to segment color images. A third application is
   presented that enables the search for fibers matching a query object in

Abstract = {{In pharmaceuticals, about 90\% of all medicines, active pharmaceutical
   ingredients are in the form of solid particles. With the development of
   nanotechnology, nanotechnology is a new approach within promising
   applications in the area of medicine, especially pharmaceutical for
   safe, controlled, and targeted drug delivery system. Nanotechnology is
   frequently applied in fiber textile, agriculture, electronics, forensic
   science, space, and medical therapeutics, namely, in disease detection,
   controlled drug delivery, as biosensors in tissue engineering. A
   nanocarrier drug delivery system formulation reduces the patient
   expenses and gives patient compliance. The major challenges in the
   development of nanoparticles as a drug delivery system are the control
   of particle size, surface properties and release of the active moiety to
   get the site-specific action at the desired rate and dose. Nanocarriers
   are being used as a transport moiety for another molecule. Nanocarriers
   are micelles, polymers, carbon-based materials, and liposome, and other
   substances are used for the delivery of drugs in the control or sustain
   release. Nanocarriers have recently been studied for their use in drug
   delivery for their unique characteristic use of chemotherapy. The
   colloidal system used in drug delivery with size ranging from 10 to 100
   nm, use for sustained drug delivery system. In the present scenario
   nanotechnology has improved the diagnosis and treatment of
   dermatological conditions. The challenges associated with nanocarriers
   through the skin permeation are one of the hurdles, and it will soon
   overcome.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical tape is found as one type of important trace evidence in
   crime scene. For example, it is very frequently used to insulate wires
   in explosive devices in many criminal cases. The fingerprints of the
   suspects were often left on the adhesive side of the tapes, which can
   provide very useful clues for the investigation and make it possible for
   individual identification. The most commonly used method to detect and
   visualize those latent fingerprints is to peel off each layer of the
   tapes first and then adopt the chemical methods to develop the
   fingerprints on the tapes. However, the peeling-off and chemical
   development process would degrade and contaminate the fingerprints and
   thus adversely affect the accuracy of identification. Optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) is a novel forensic imaging modality based on low
   coherence interferometry, which has the advantages of non-destruction,
   micrometer-level high resolution and cross-sectional imaging. In this
   study, a fiber-based spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) system with similar to
   6 mu m resolution was employed to obtain the image of fingerprint
   sandwiched between two opaque electrical tapes without any
   pre-processing procedure like peeling-off. Three-dimensional (3D) OCT
   reconstruction was performed and the subsurface image was produced to
   visualize the latent fingerprints. The results demonstrate that OCT is a
   promising tool for recovering the latent fingerprints hidden beneath
   opaque electrical tape non-destructively and rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{It has been a puzzling forensic task to determine the cause of death as
   a result of old myocardial infarction (OMI) in the absence of
   recognizable acute myocardial infarction. Recent studies indicated that
   the heterogeneous cardiac nerve sprouting and sympathetic
   hyperinnervation at border zones of the infarcted site played important
   roles in sudden cardiac death (SCD). So, the present study explored the
   value of growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and tyrosine hydroxylase
   (TH) as objective and specific neural biomarkers combined with
   Masson-trichrome staining for forensic autopsy cases. Myocardium of left
   ventricle of 58 medicolegal autopsy cases, 12 OMI cases, 12 acute/OMI
   cases, and 34 control cases, were immunostained with anti-GAP-43 and
   anti-TH antibodies. Immunoreactivity of GAP-43 and TH identified nerve
   fibers and vascular wall in OMI cases and acute/OMI cases. Specifically,
   TH-positive nerve fibers were abundant at border zones of the infarcted
   site. There were a few GAP-43 and TH expressions in the control cases.
   With Masson-trichrome staining, collagen fibers were blue and cardiac
   muscle fibers were pink in marked contrast with the surrounding tissue,
   which improved the location of nerve fibers. Thus, these findings
   suggest that immunohistochemical detection of GAP-43 and TH combined
   with Masson-trichrome staining can provide the evidence for the
   medicolegal expertise of SCD due to OMI, and further demonstrate a close
   relationship between sympathetic hyperinnervation and SCD.}},

Abstract = {{Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains one of the major causes of unexpected
   death. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) before the first 12 hours is
   always difficult for forensic pathologists. The morphologic changes
   associated with MI are not often able to estimate accurately when the
   actual infarct occurred. Our study utilizes the importance of the C9
   immunohistochemical biomarker in an attempt to identify this early phase
   of MI. Different cases with various acute ischemic myocardial lesions,
   early myocardial infarction and old scarring infarction were
   investigated in order to establish the certain diagnose of myocardial
   infarction. The study cases were divided in three groups. Group I with
   chronic cardiac changes or pathologies, group II with myocardial
   necrosis and group III for control, with two cases with violent death.
   For the first group, the immunohistochemical (IHC) reaction was negative
   in the myocardial fibers as well as rest of the sample, also proving a
   positive immunohistochemical marking in the vascular region, which
   validated our results. In the second group, the C9 staining was stronger
   in the cases with necrotic myocardial fibers, from early stages of the
   myocardial infarction (24-48 hours and also for 48-72 hours), to lesions
   7-10 days old. In the control group (group III) the staining in myocytes
   was negative. The immunohistochemical expression of C9 has an important
   diagnosis role for recent myocardial infarction and it could become a
   standard in forensic laboratory analysis. This method is very useful in
   forensic practice and can easily determine the diagnostic for recent
   myocardial infarction.}},

   Field-Induced Mechanical Impingement}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Cotton-tipped applicator swabs are used as a collection device for many
   biological samples and its complete elution is a desired step for
   clinical and forensic diagnostics. Swabs are used to collect infectious
   body fluids, where the concentration of pathogens can range from 1 x
   10(4) CFU/mL (colony forming units/mL) in respiratory-tract infections
   and 1 x 10(5) in urinary-tract infections, to up to 1 x 10(9) CFU/mL in
   salivary samples. These samples are then eluted and lysed, prior to DNA
   (De-oxy Ribonucleic Acid) analysis. The recovery of micro-organisms from
   a matrix of swab fibres depends on the nature of the body fluid, the
   type of the swab fibres, and the process of elution. Various methods to
   elute samples from swab include chemical digestion of fibres (similar to
   20\% recovery), centrifugation (similar to 58\% recovery), piezoelectric
   vibration, or pressurized fluid-flow (similar to 60\% recovery). This
   study reports a magnetically-actuated physical impingement method for
   elution and recovery of artificial sputum samples from cotton fibres. A
   device has been fabricated to induce a rotating magnetic field on
   smaller magnetic particles in a vial that strikes the swab within a
   confined gap. Elution from the swab in this device was characterized
   using 2\% Methyl cellulose in deionised water, loaded with
   fluorescent-tagged polystyrene beads and E. coli at various
   concentrations. The recovery efficiency was found to increase with both
   rotational speed and elution time, but plateaus after 400 RPM
   (Revolutions per minute) and 120 s, respectively. At a higher
   concentration of polystyrene beads (5 x 10(8) particles/mL), a maximum
   recovery of similar to 85\% was achieved. With lower concentration, (1 x
   10(5) particles/mL) the maximum efficiency (similar to 92.8\%) was found
   to be almost twice of passive elution (46.7\%). In the case of E. coli,
   the corresponding recovery efficiency at 3.35 x 10(5) CFU/mL is 90.4\%
   at 500 RPM and 120 s. This elution method is expected to have a wide
   applicability in clinical diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{Textiles are a valuable source of forensic evidence and the nature and
   condition of textiles collected from a crime scene can assist
   investigators in determining the nature of the death and aid in the
   identification of the victim. Until now, much of the knowledge of
   textile degradation in forensic contexts has been based on the visual
   inspection of material collected from soil environments. The purpose of
   the current study was to investigate the potential of a more
   quantitative approach to the understanding of forensic textile
   degradation through the application of infrared spectroscopy.
   Degradation patterns of natural and synthetic textile materials as they
   were subjected to a natural outdoor environment in Australia were
   investigated. Cotton, polyester and polyester-cotton blend textiles were
   placed on a soil surface during the summer and winter seasons and were
   analysed over periods 1 and 1.5 years, respectively, and examined using
   attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy. Statistical analysis of
   the spectral data obtained for the cotton material correlated with
   visual degradation and a difference in the onset of degradation between
   the summer and winter season was revealed. The synthetic material did
   not show any signs of degradation either visually or statistically
   throughout the experimental period and highlighted the importance of
   material type in terms of preservation. The cotton section from the
   polyester-cotton blend samples was found to behave in a similar manner
   to that of the 100\% cotton samples, however principal component
   analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the degradation patterns were less
   distinct in both the summer and winter trial for the blend samples.
   These findings indicated that the presence of the synthetic material may
   have inhibited the degradation of the natural material. The use of
   statistics to analyse the spectral data obtained for textiles of
   forensic interest provides a better foundation for the interpretation of
   the data obtained using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, and has provided insight
   into textile degradation processes relevant to a soil environment. (C)

Title = {{Histological transformations of the dental pulp as possible indicator of
   post mortem interval: a pilot study}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{279}},
Pages = {{251-257}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: The correct estimation of the post mortem interval (PMI) can
   be crucial on the success of a forensic investigation. Diverse methods
   have been used to estimate PMI, considering physical changes that occur
   after death, such as mortis algor, livor mortis, among others.
   Degradation after death of dental pulp is a complex process that has not
   yet been studied thoroughly. It has been described that pulp RNA
   degradation could be an indicator of PMI, however this study is limited
   to 6 days. The tooth is the hardest organ of the human body, and within
   is confined dental pulp. The pulp morphology is defined as a lax
   conjunctive tissue with great sensory innervation, abundant
   microcirculation and great presence of groups of cell types.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to describe the potential use of pulp post
   mortem alterations to estimate PMI, using a new methodology that will
   allow obtainment of pulp tissue to be used for histomorphological
   analysis. The current study will identify potential histological
   indicators in dental pulp tissue to estimate PMI in time intervals of 24
   h, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.
   Materials and method: This study used 26 teeth from individuals with
   known PMI of 24 h, 1 month, 3 months or 6 months. All samples were
   manipulated with the new methodology (Carrasco, P. and Inostroza C.
   inventors; Universidad de los Andes, assignee. Forensic identification,
   post mortem interval estimation and cause of death determination by
   recovery of dental tissue. United State patent US 61/826,558 23.05.2013)
   to extract pulp tissue without the destruction of the tooth. The dental
   pulp tissues obtained were fixed in formalin for the subsequent
   generation of histological sections, stained with Hematoxylin Eosin and
   Masson's Trichrome. All sections were observed under an optical
   microscope using magnifications of 10x and 40x.
   Results: The microscopic analysis of the samples showed a progressive
   transformation of the cellular components and fibers of dental pulp
   along PMI. These results allowed creating a chart of qualitative and
   quantitative parameters to be used on the estimation on PMI based on
   microscopic degradation of dental pulp.
   Conclusions: The histological transformations of dental pulp as a
   function of time can be used as PMI indicators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A man in his late forties had lived as a recluse for more than ten
   years. He was found dead in his room. At autopsy, subarachnoid
   hemorrhage (SAH) was detected at the base of the brain, which weighed
   1333g. The cerebellar tonsil was swollen. The cerebral ventricle was
   enlarged and filled with blood. A hematoma was observed in the upper
   part of the left side of the cerebellar hemisphere. The location and
   size of SAH in this case indicated that the rupture of a cerebral
   aneurysm (CA) had occurred; however, CA was not detected. A mass of
   blood vessels buried in the hematoma was observed at the left
   cerebellopontine angle (CPA). The vascular lesion showed round-shaped
   blood vessels as well as flat-shaped vessels with the appearance of
   veins, but with elastic fibers indicative of arteries. The lesion was
   considered to be the nidus and was 5-8mm in size. Feeding arteries
   appeared to be from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA).
   However, the draining vein and anastomotic parts of the artery and vein
   were not confirmed. Based on these histopathological features, this
   vascular lesion was diagnosed as arteriovenous malformation (AVM). A
   differential diagnosis between AVM at CPA and CA is needed in order to
   identify the source of non-traumatic SAH.}},

Title = {{A preliminary investigation of textile fibers in smothering scenarios

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Was this group of target fibers transferred during a criminal action? Is
   it possible that it was transferred during another legitimate activity?
   Acquiring knowledge about the activity, whether legitimate or criminal,
   leading to the transfer of a group of fibers is a recurring challenge
   encountered throughout the evidence interpretation process. Trace
   evidence such as fibers may assist with generating a reasoning of the
   activity which produced the trace, but this assumes that one already has
   a thorough understanding of the transfer phenomenon. How to generate and
   then use such relevant knowledge? What are the influencing parameters
   and which ones should (or can) be controlled?
   The present work focuses on homicides by smothering using a pillow and
   the transfer of fibers on the face of the victim in such events. A
   legitimate activity - represented by a night's sleep on a pillow - was
   also investigated since such legitimate, alternative explanations
   concerning the presence of fibers could likely be formulated by the
   suspect.
   The number and distribution of fibers transferred onto the victim's face
   in either scenario were investigated and interpreted using a Bayesian
   approach. Results showed that the shedding capacity of the pillowcase
   strongly impact the number of fibers recovered. The nature of the
   action, modus operandi and amount of friction could not be excluded in
   their influence on the transfer of fibers. Finally, likelihood ratios
   indicating the number of fibers recovered from the victim's face can
   provide relevant information by supporting either criminal or legitimate
   proposition (i.e., smothering or night's sleep scenario). (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Cannabis saliva L. is cultivated for its fiber or seeds (var. saliva;
   hemp), or for its high content in cannabinoids (var. indica; marijuana).
   Knowledge of the genetic structure of C. sativa var. indica is important
   for selection and breeding of cultivars with medicinal interest. We used
   six genomic SSRs (gSSRs) for genotyping 154 individual plants of 20
   cultivars of C. sativa var. indica, plus two cultivars of C. sativa var.
   sativa. A very high polymorphism was observed, with an average of 17
   alleles and 23.8 genotypes per locus. Expected (H-e) and observed (H-o)
   heterozygosities were high, with average values of 0.753 and 0.429,
   respectively. In some cultivars H-e and H-o presented similar values,
   while in others H-e was considerably higher than H-o suggesting that
   consanguinity and fixation had taken place during its development. In
   addition, some cultivars had a reduced number of alleles per locus (in
   some cases only two) indicating that a genetic bottleneck had taken
   place during its development. Gene flow (Nm) between both botanical
   varieties was high, with Nm = 1.736. The molecular analysis of variance
   (AMOVA) revealed that only 31.94\% of the molecular variation observed
   was caused by differences among cultivars, while the variation among
   plants of the same cultivar was of 37.11\%, and within individual
   variation, due to heterozygosity, was of 30.96\%. This indicates that a
   large variation exists within cultivars, which can be exploited for
   selection, but also complicates germplasm management and regeneration.
   The population structure analysis identified 14 genetic clusters, with
   most individuals of a single cultivar clustering together. This
   analysis, together with UPGMA cluster analysis shows that the two C.
   saliva var. saliva cultivars studied are differentiated from C. sativa
   var. indica, and that some cultivars of C. saliva var. indica seem to
   represent different selections from a common original cultivar. Our
   results represent the first comprehensive study of intra-varietal
   diversity in C. sativa var. indica and provide information of relevance
   for selection, breeding, and germplasm conservation, as well as for
   forensic studies in this crop.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Species identification of hair is routinely done by
   microscopic analysis. Following previous studies that used protein
   analysis to characterize species markers in hair and wool, the present
   work aims at covering a larger number of species and to ultimately offer
   a method for rapid hair identification in forensics and archaeology.
   Methods: Hair is mostly made of alpha-keratins; these proteins have only
   been sequenced in a handful of species and most animal families are
   under-represented. Using a methodology developed for the
   characterization of peptidic markers in tissues such as bone (peptide
   mass fingerprinting or PMF) and commonly applied on collagen, hair from
   common North American fur-bearing species was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS
   to obtain peptidic profiles.
   Results: Alpha-keratin peptides that are typically dominant on peptide
   mass profiles of hair were chosen as markers. Matching peaks were
   identified for each species tested and compared to known sequences from
   related organisms whenever possible. The markers were used to create a
   flowchart to narrow down identification to the family level.
   Conclusions: The methodology was developed on a limited numbers of
   markers chosen for their variability and reliability on the peptide mass
   fingerprint. In the absence of genetic sequences, this strategy is a
   quick way to compare species from a common geographic origin. The work
   presented here was focused on North American species but could be
   applied to other animal families.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing numbers of Police forces using drones for crime scene
   surveillance, the effect of the drones on trace evidence present needs
   evaluation. In this investigation the effect of flying a quadcopter
   drone at different heights over a controlled scene and taking off at
   different distances from the scene were measured. Yarn was placed on a
   range of floor surfaces and the number lost or moved from their original
   position was recorded.
   It was possible to estimate ``safe{''} distances above and take off
   distance from the bath mat (2 m and 1 m respectively), and carpet tile
   (3 m and 1 m) which were the roughest surfaces. The maximum distances
   tested of 5 m above and 2 m from was not far enough to prevent
   significant disturbance with the other floor surfaces. This report
   illustrates the importance of considering the impact of new technologies
   into a forensic workflow on established forensic evidence prior to

Abstract = {{Seven cases and a quality assurance test are presented. In these cases,

   improves the evidential value of forensic fibre examinations, as it
   becomes possible to distinguish textiles that are different in dye
   chemistry, but have a similar colour. In addition dye analysis makes the
   examination more robust, as it becomes possible to attribute colour

Abstract = {{In forensic casework, non-invasive and minimally-invasive methods for
   postmortem examinations are extremely valuable. Whole body postmortem
   computed tomography (PMCT) is often used to provide visualization of the
   internal characteristics of a body prior to more invasive procedures and
   has also been used to locate gas reservoirs inside the body to assist in
   determining cause of death. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that
   exploiting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) located in these gas
   reservoirs by comprehensive two-dimensional gas
   chromatography-high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (GCxGC-HRTOF-MS) may assist in providing information regarding the
   postmortem interval. The aim of the current study was to further develop
   the procedures related to solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and
   GCxGC-HRTOF-MS analysis of gas reservoirs collected from deceased
   individuals. SPME fiber extraction parameters, internal standard
   approach, and sample stability were investigated. Altering the SPME
   parameters increased the selectivity and sensitivity for the VOC
   profile, and the use of a mixed deuterated internal standard contributed
   to data quality. Samples were found to be stable up to 6 weeks but were
   recommended to be analyzed within 4 weeks due to higher variation
   observed beyond this point. In addition, 29 VOC markers of interest were
   identified, and heart and/or abdominal cavity samples were suggested as
   a possible standardized sampling location for future studies. The data
   presented in this study will contribute to the long-term goal of
   producing a routine, accredited method for minimally-invasive VOC
   analysis in postmortem examinations.}},

Title = {{The transfer of diatoms from freshwater to footwear materials: An
   experimental study assessing transfer, persistence, and extraction
   methods for forensic reconstruction}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE \& JUSTICE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{In recent years there has been growing interest in environmental forms
   of trace evidence, and ecological trace evidence collected from footwear
   has proved valuable within casework. Simultaneously, there has been
   growing awareness of the need for empirical experimentation to underpin
   forensic inferences. Diatoms are unicellular algae, and each cell (or
   `frustule') consists of two valves which are made of silica, a robust
   material that favours their preservation both in sediments and within
   forensic scenarios. A series of experiments were carried out to
   investigate the transfer and persistence of diatoms upon common footwear
   materials, a recipient surface that has historically been overlooked by
   studies of persistence. The effectiveness of two novel extraction
   techniques (jet rinsing, and heating and agitation with distilled water)
   was compared to the established extraction technique of hydrogen
   peroxide digestion, for a suite of five common footwear materials:
   canvas, leather, and `suede' (representing upper materials), and rubber
   and polyurethane (representing sole materials). It was observed that the
   novel extraction technique of heating and agitation with distilled water
   did not extract fewer diatom valves, or cause increased fragmentation of
   valves, when compared to peroxide digestion, suggesting that the method
   may be viable where potentially hazardous chemical reactions may be
   encountered with the peroxide digestion method.
   Valves could be extracted from all five footwear materials after 3 min
   of immersion, and more valves were extracted from the rougher, woven
   upper materials than the smoother sole materials. Canvas yielded the
   most valves (a mean of 2511/cm(2)) and polyurethane the fewest (a mean
   of 15/cm(2)). The persistence of diatoms on the three upper materials
   was addressed with a preliminary pilot investigation, with ten intervals
   sampled between 0 and 168 h. Valves were seen to persist in detectable
   quantities after 168 h on all three upper materials. However, some
   samples produced slides with no valves, and the earliest time after
   which no diatom valves were found was 4 h after the transfer. Analysis
   of the particle size distributions over time, by image analysis,
   suggests that the retention of diatoms may be size-selective; after 168
   h, no particles larger than 200 mu m(2) could be found on the samples of
   canvas, and >95\% of the particles on the samples of suede were less
   than or equal to 200 mu m(2). A pilot investigation into the effects of
   immersion interval was carried out upon samples of canvas. Greater
   numbers of valves were extracted from the samples with longer immersion
   intervals, but even after 30 s, >500 valves could be recovered per
   cm(2), suggesting that footwear may be sampled for diatoms even if the
   contact with a water body may have been brief. These findings indicate
   that, if the variability within and between experimental runs can be
   addressed, there is significant potential for diatoms to be incorporated
   into the trace analysis of footwear and assist forensic reconstructions.

   reported in this paper not only is designed for penetration but also

   the measurement of Raman intensity relative to some standard is not
   always feasible with conventional probes. In the Raman probe described
   here, this capability is realized through the use of a c-axis
   single-crystal sapphire fiber as an interface between the probe body and
   the sample. As an illustration of how this probe can be put to use, the
   Raman spectrum from the interior of porcine fat has been obtained.
   Situations where this probe may be the preferred choice include
   subcutaneous and subterranean measurements as well as forensic

Abstract = {{Introduction: Neurographic data on Wallerian degeneration (WD) after
   motor nerve injury are available only from animal studies and human case
   reports of 9 patients altogether. A precise knowledge of neurographic
   features of WD would be highly relevant for diagnostic, prognostic,
   therapeutic, and forensic aspects of traumatic lesions. Methods: We
   prospectively studied WD in patients with a peripheral nerve injury.
   They underwent sequential neurographic examinations beginning no later
   than 3 days after the injury until a plateau of the amplitude of
   compound muscle action potential was reached. Results: We examined 20
   injured nerves from 16 patients. Four days after injury, all nerves
   showed amplitude decay to some extent, whereas 85\% had reached their
   plateau at day 8. A length dependency of WD could be demonstrated.
   Conclusion: In humans, WD starts no later than day 4, shows length
   dependency, and is completed at day 8 in most nerves.}},

Abstract = {{Segmental hair analysis offers a longer period for retrospective drug
   detection than blood or urine. Hair is a keratinous fiber and is
   strongly hydrophobic. The embedding of drugs in hydrophobic hair at low
   concentrations makes it difficult for extraction and detection with
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) coupled with mass
   spectrometric imaging (MSI). In this study, a single scalp hair was
   longitudinally cut with a cryostat section to a length of 4 mm and fixed
   onto a stainless steel MALDI plate. Umbelliferone was used as a new
   hydrophobic matrix to enrich and assist the ionization efficiency of
   methamphetamine in the hair sample. MALDI-Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance (FTICR)-MS profiling and imaging were performed for
   direct detection and mapping of methamphetamine on the longitudinal
   sections of the single hair sample in positive ion mode. Using
   MALDI-MSI, the distribution of methamphetamine was observed throughout
   five longitudinally sectioned hair samples from a drug abuser. The
   changes of methamphetamine were also semi-quantified by comparing the
   ratios of methamphetamine/internal standard (I.S). This method improves
   the detection sensitivity of target drugs embedded in a hair matrix for
   imaging with mass spectrometry. The method could provide a detection
   level of methamphetamine down to a nanogram per milligram incorporated
   into hair. The results were also compared with the conventional high
   performance liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS)
   method. Changes in the imaging results over time by the MSI method
   showed good semi-quantitative correlation to the results from the
   HPLC-MS/MS method. This study provides a powerful tool for drug abuse
   control and forensic medicine analysis in a narrow time frame, and a
   reduction in the sample amount required. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

   cannabis was developed. The seized cannabis was extracted in methanol by
   sonication. The binary mobile phase consisted of methanol (containing
   0.1\% formic acid) and water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
   separated on Waters UPLC BEH C18 column (50 mmx2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m) with
   isocratic elution at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The three cannabinoids
   were analyzed by photodiode array (PDA) detector at 220 nm and confirmed
   by mass spectrometer QDa. The correlation coefficient of standard curve
   for the three cannabinoids in linearity range was not less than 0.999,
   as well as the recoveries were 82\%-102\% with the relative standard
   deviations (RSD) of 0.36\%-4.12\% at three spiked levels. The method is
   specific, easy, quick and suitable for confirmation of the cannabinoids
   in seized cannabis. Cannabis plants in different areas were classified
   by their chemical phenotype as drug-type or fiber-type plants, taking
   into account the phenotypic index Delta 9-THC, (Delta 9-THC+CBN)/CBD, or
   the Delta 9-THC/CBD and the (Delta 9-THC+CBN)/CBD ratios. The analysis
   of the original composition of plant material is necessary for the

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{A series of soil transference experiments (STEs) were undertaken to
   determine whether patterns identified in laboratory experiments could
   also be recognised at a simulated crime scene in the field. A clothed 55
   kg human rescue dummy dressed in a padded bra was either dragged or
   merely placed on a soil surface at sites with natural and anthropogenic
   soil types under both wet and dry soil conditions. Transfer patterns
   produced by dragging compared favourably with those of laboratory
   experiments. Twelve patterns were identified when a clothed human rescue
   dummy was dragged across the two soil types in the field. This expanded
   the original set of eight soil transfer patterns identified from
   dragging weighted fabric across soil samples in the laboratory.
   Soil transferred by placing the human rescue dummy resulted in a set of
   six transfer patterns that were different to those produced by dragging.
   By comparing trace soil patterns transferred to bras using each transfer
   method, it was revealed that certain transfer patterns on bras could
   indicate how the fabric had made contact with a soil surface. A
   photographic method was developed for crime scene examiners to capture
   this often subtle soil evidence before a body is transported or the
   clothing removed.
   This improved understanding of the dynamics of soil transference to bras
   and related clothing fabric may assist forensic investigators
   reconstruct the circumstances of a variety of forensic events. (C) 2017

Journal = {{FORENSIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{67-74}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this research was to investigate the potential of a novel
   preconcentration device, capillary micro-extraction of volatiles (CMV),
   for the application of breath analysis. The CMV offers dynamic sampling
   of volatile to semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by the simple
   coupling of an adapter to a GC inlet for GC/MS analysis, in comparison
   to the expensive thermal desorption units needed for sorbent tubes. It
   additionally offers an increased surface area over a single SPME fiber.
   The CMV was used to sample and extract 108 compounds from the breath of
   11 self-reported cigarette smokers and 7 non-smokers. Twelve (12)
   compounds were determined to be statistically significant between the
   groups. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant
   Analysis (LDA) were used to distinguish the groups, resulting in 100\%
   correct classification of all non-smokers. In some cases, nicotine was
   not detected in smokers and therefore some of those smokers were
   confused with the non-smokers. Nicotine was detected in the breath of
   64\% of all cigarette smokers with an average mass of 143 +/- 31 pg from
   the approximate 5-liter breath sample collected within 1 h after
   smoking. The successful use of the CMV sampler for preconcentration of
   breath to distinguish between smokers and non-smokers serves as a proof
   of concept for future applications of the CMV for detection of marijuana
   smokers' breath for impaired driver management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{275}},
Pages = {{178-186}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study assessed the recovery of flock fibres used as a tracer in a
   car exchange scenario. Flock fibres were deposited onto a car seat (or
   model thereof) and their transfer and persistence was investigated after
   a real or simulated car exchange. The overall aim of this study was to
   achieve an optimal use of flock fibres as tracers, i.e. to be able to
   select a fit-for-purpose flock fibre, to be able to predict the amount
   of flock fibres to be recovered from crime related items, and to be able
   to use these numbers to exclude accidental uptake. The effect of a
   number of variables on the transfer and persistence of flock fibres was
   studied, including flock fibre length, car upholstery, and trousers
   material. Laboratory based experiments were undertaken first, followed
   by realistic field based experiments. The flock fibres were captured in
   a non-destructive manner through fluorescence photography. A Matlab
   algorithm enabled fast automated counting of flock fibres on the images.
   Results indicate that an initial rapid loss of flock fibres from
   garments may be expected as a result of moderate movement. Although the
   amount of flock fibres to be recovered is affected by the flock fibre
   length, the type of car upholstery, and the type of trousers materials
   (if frictional force is taken into consideration), large numbers of
   flock fibres have been recovered from all target materials throughout
   the transfer route. These numbers are higher than the amount of flock
   fibres recovered due to accidental uptake. In conclusion, flock fibres
   can serve as invisible evidence to reconstruct a series of events. (C)

Abstract = {{Recognizing post-mortem (PM) changes is of crucial importance in
   veterinary forensic pathology. In porcine wounds established PM
   contradicting observations regarding infiltration of leukocytes have
   been described. In the present study, skin, subcutis and muscle tissue
   sampled from experimental pigs with PM incised wounds (n = 8), PM
   bruises (n = 8) and no lesions, i.e. controls (n = 4), were examined for
   signs of vitality over time. All tissue samples were subjected to gross
   and histopathological evaluation. Hemorrhages were present along the
   edges of PM incised wounds but deposits of fibrin were never observed.
   PM bruise led to hemorrhage in the subcutis visible on cross section of
   the skin in 3 out of 8 pigs. Histologically, hemorrhages in the
   subcutaneous tissue and disrupted muscle fibers were observed in PM
   bruises and could not be differentiated from similar lesions in
   ante-mortem (AM) bruises. Vital reactions, i.e. infiltrating leukocytes,
   hyper-leukocytosis and pavement of leukocytes, were absent in all
   incised wounds and bruises regardless of the time of sampling after
   traumatization.
   In conclusion, a vital reaction was not present in PM incised wounds,
   regardless of the time of sampling. Moreover, it was found that AM
   bruises free of leukocyte infiltration cannot be distinguished from PM
   bruises, an observation which is of crucial importance when timing
   bruises in forensic cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Remodelling of myocardial intercalated disc protein connexin 43 causes
   increased susceptibility to malignant arrhythmias in ARVC/D patients}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{275}},
Pages = {{14-22}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia
   (ARVC/D) is a primary cardiomyopathy characterised by fibrofatty
   replacement and ventricular arrhythmias. The occurrence of malignant
   arrhythmias may be associated with fatty infiltration and intercalated
   disk remodelling, but the specific pathological remodelling pattern is
   not yet clear.
   Methods: Twelve explanted hearts from patients diagnosed with ARVC/D
   according to the 2010 Task Force Criteria and pathology examination were
   divided into two groups with (SVT, n = 6) or without (non- SVT, n = 6)
   recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) before heart
   transplantation. Six ARVC autopsy hearts and six normal donor hearts
   were also collected. We evaluated the fibrofatty infiltration by Masson
   staining and the expression of intercalated disc proteins through
   immunohistochemistry staining combined with western blot using the
   ventricular tissue of ARVC as well as normal hearts.
   Results: There was significant fatty replacement in the right ventricles
   of both the SVT and the non- SVT groups compared to normal hearts, but
   no significant differences were found in fibre, fatty and residual
   myocardium components between these two groups. Immunohistochemistry and
   western blot further showed disturbed distribution and significantly
   reduced expression of Connexin 43 (Cx43) in the SVT group (SVT vs.
   Normal P = 0.010, SVT vs. non- SVT P = 0.012). No significantly
   diminished expression was found in the non- SVT group. The cardiac
   histology of ARVC/D patients with sudden death verified by forensic
   pathology confirmed a similar phenomenon.
   Conclusion: Our pathology study on explanted and autopsied hearts
   indicates that the expression of Cx43 was significantly reduced and
   disturbed in distribution in ARVC/D myocardium with sustained
   ventricular tachycardia, but not in patients without malignant
   ventricular arrhythmias. This implies a correlation between Cx43
   remodelling and malignant arrhythmias in ARVC/D patients. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{A headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique was used to
   quantitate the concentration of volatile hydrocarbons from the blood of
   cadavers by cryogenic gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. A total of
   24 compounds including aromatic and aliphatic volatile hydrocarbons were
   analyzed by this method. The analytes in the headspace of 0.1 g of blood
   mixed with 1.0 mL of distilled water plus 1 mu L of an internal standard
   solution were adsorbed onto a 100-ae m polydimethylsiloxane fiber at 0
   degrees C for 15 min, and measured using a GC-MS full scan method. The
   limit of quantitation for the analytes ranged from 6.8 to 10 ng per 1 g
   of blood. This method was applied to actual autopsy cases to quantitate
   the level of volatile hydrocarbons (VHCs) in the blood of cadavers who
   died in fire-related incidents. The patterns of the VHCs revealed the
   presence or absence of accelerants. Petroleum-based fuels such as
   gasoline and kerosene were differentiated. The detection of C8-C13
   aliphatic hydrocarbons indicated the presence of kerosene; the detection
   of C3 alkylbenzenes in the absence of C8-C13 aliphatic hydrocarbons was
   indicative of gasoline; and elevated levels of styrene or benzene in the
   absence of C3/C4 alkylbenzenes and aliphatic hydrocarbons indicated a
   normal construction fire. This sensitive HS-SPME method could help aid
   the investigation of fire-related deaths by providing a simple pattern
   to use for the interpretation of VHCs in human blood.}},

Title = {{Developmental and internal validation of a novel 13 loci STR multiplex
   method for Cannabis sativa DNA profiling}},
Journal = {{LEGAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{33-40}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Marijuana (Cannabis sativa L.) is a plant cultivated and trafficked
   worldwide as a source of fiber (hemp), medicine, and intoxicant. The
   development of a validated method using molecular techniques such as
   short tandem repeats (STRs) could serve as an intelligence tool to link
   multiple cases by means of genetic individualization or association of
   cannabis samples. For this purpose, a 13 loci STR multiplex method was
   developed, optimized, and validated according to relevant ISFG and
   SWGDAM guidelines. The STR multiplex consists of 13 previously described
   C sativa STR loci: ANUCS501, 9269, 4910, 5159, ANUCS305, 9043, B05,
   1528, 3735, CS1, D02, C11, and H06. A sequenced allelic ladder
   consisting of 56 alleles was designed to accurately genotype 101 C
   sativa samples from three seizures provided by a U. S. Customs and
   Border Protection crime lab. Using an optimal range of DNA (0.5-1.0 ng),
   validation studies revealed well-balanced electropherograms (inter-locus
   balance range: 0.500-1.296), relatively balanced heterozygous peaks
   (mean peak height ratio of 0.83 across all loci) with minimal artifacts
   and stutter ratio (mean stutter of 0.021 across all loci). This
   multi-locus system is relatively sensitive (0.13 ng of template DNA)
   with a combined power of discrimination of 1 in 55 million. The 13 STR
   panel was found to be species specific for C sativa; however,
   non-specific peaks were produced with Humulus lupulus. The results of
   this research demonstrate the robustness and applicability of this 13
   loci STR system for forensic DNA profiling of marijuana samples. (C)

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We present a method in which DNA and fibre traces are jointly recovered
   by taping. The DNA traces are isolated by standard laboratory
   procedures. Fibre traces are isolated afterwards in order to improve
   efficiency.
   Two tests have been carried out to evaluate the suitability of the
   presented method. In the first test, possible changes in appearance of
   fibres due to the DNA isolation procedures are investigated. In the
   second test, the recovery of fibres from a contaminated surface and
   their possible loss due to the DNA isolation procedure are investigated.
   It is concluded that polyester fibres are hardly affected by the DNA
   isolation procedure. In contrast, a relatively large number of the
   investigated cotton fibres were altered. The observed differences do not
   indicate a structural damage to the fibre or the dyes, but rather the
   washing-out of some components. The observed changes may require that
   fibres from a known source are also exposed to the DNA isolation
   procedures to assess the induced changes, but do not prevent a
   meaningful comparison. The recovery of fibres is slightly lower than the
   routine procedures for fibre recovery. Therefore, it was decided to
   perform extra taping of the recipient in cases where fibre investigation
   is requested.
   During DNA-isolation, some of the fibres present are released from the
   tapes. These fibres are not lost however, as they can be found on the
   filter in the used DNA isolation vials. (C) 2017 The Chartered Society

Abstract = {{Conducting in vitro research for forensic, impact and injury simulation
   modelling generally involves the use of a skull simulant with mechanical
   properties similar to those found in the human skull. For this study
   epoxy resin, fibre filled epoxy resin, 3D-printing filaments (PETG, PLA)
   and self-cure acrylic denture base resin were used to fabricate the
   specimens (n=20 per material group), according to ISO 527-2 IBB and
   15020795-1. Tensile and flexural testing in a universal testing machine
   was used to measure their tensile/flexural elastic modulus and strength.
   The results showed that the epoxy resin and fibre filled epoxy resin had
   similar tensile elastic moduli (no statistical significant difference)
   with lower values observed for the other materials. The fibre filled
   epoxy resin had a considerably higher flexural elastic modulus and
   strength, possibly attributed to the presence of fibres. Of the
   simulants tested, epoxy resin had an elastic modulus and flexural
   strength close to that of mean human skull values reported in the
   literature, and thus can be considered as a suitable skull simulant for
   a skin/skull/brain model for lower impact forces that do not exceed the
   fracture stress. For higher impact forces a 3D-printing filament (PIA)
   may be a more suitable skull simulant material, due to its closer match
   to fracture stresses found in human skull bone. Influencing factors were
   also anisotropy, heterogeneity and viscoelasticity of human skull bone
   and simulant specimens.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic science is a wide field comprising of several subspecialties
   and uses methods derived from natural sciences for finding criminals and
   other evidence valid in a legal court. A relatively new area;
   Nano-forensics brings a new era of investigation in forensic science in
   which instantaneous results can be produced that determine various
   agents such as explosive gasses, biological agents and residues in
   different crime scenes and terrorist activity investigations. This can
   be achieved by applying Nanotechnology and its associated
   characterization techniques in forensic sciences. Several
   characterization techniques exist in Nanotechnology and nano-analysis is
   one such technique that is used in forensic science which includes
   Electron microscopes (EM) like Transmission (TEM) and Scanning (SEM),
   Raman microscopy (Micro - Raman) and Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPMs)
   like Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).
   Atomic force microscopy enables surface characterization of different
   materials by examining their morphology and mechanical properties.
   Materials that are immeasurable such as hair, body fluids, textile
   fibers, documents, polymers, pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs), etc.
   are often encountered during forensic investigations. This review
   article will mainly focus on the use of AFM in the examination of
   different evidence such as blood stains, forged documents, human hair
   samples, ammunitions, explosives, and other such applications in the
   field of Forensic Science. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to explore the current green burial clothing
   movement by examining three designers' work using a multi-case study
   approach. Green burial incorporates a sustainability concept into
   funeral practices. Cradle-to-cradle, as opposed to cradle-to-grave, is a
   model for sustainability practices that plan for the product lifecycle
   to continue after consumer use of the product has concluded. The works
   of Mark Mitchell, Jae Rhim Lee and Pia Interlandi were selected for the
   three cases of green burial practices in the context of cradle-to-cradle
   design using the five steps to eco-effectiveness. They used natural
   fibers in their clothing designed for green burial, and created clothing
   intended to be non-toxic to the soil and groundwater when buried with
   the body. Jae Rhim Lee's designs included a mushroom culture to aid in
   decomposition of the body and remediation of toxins found in the body,
   resulting in compostable soil. In addition to the multi-case study, this
   study also examined a wide variety of primary and secondary research
   literature from the fields of forensics, archaeology, and textile
   science to identify current purchase options for green burial clothing
   and to inform suggestions for future development of green burial apparel
   within the context of cradle-to-cradle design. This study also urged the
   importance of consumer awareness in terms of the choice of burial
   clothing if considering the full implementation of the cradle-to-cradle
   design principles into green burial clothing practices. The findings of
   this study call for further research on sustainability in burial
   clothing.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Microspectrophotometry is a quick, accurate, and reproducible method to
   compare colored fibers for forensic purposes. Applying chemometric
   techniques to spectroscopic data can provide valuable information,
   especially when looking at a complex dataset. In this study, background
   subtracted and normalized visible spectra from ten yellow polyester
   exemplars dyed with different concentrations of the same dye ranging
   from 0.1\% to 3.5\% (w/w), were analyzed by agglomerative hierarchical
   clustering (AHC), principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant
   analysis (DA). Systematic changes in the wavelength of maximum
   absorption, peak shape and signal-to-background ratio were noted as dye
   loading increased. In general, classifying the samples into ten groups
   (one for each exemplar) had poor accuracy (i.e., 51\%). However,
   classification was much more accurate (i.e., 96\%) using three classes
   of fibers that were identified by AHC as having low (0.10-0.20 wt\%),
   medium (0.40-0.75 wt\%), and high (1.5-3.5 wt\%) dye loadings. An
   external validation with additional fibers and data generated by
   independent analysts confirmed these findings. Lastly, it was also
   possible to discriminating pairs of exemplars with small differences in
   dye loadings as a simulation of questioned (Q) versus known (K)
   comparisons. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In animal bites, the dental attributes can be fundamental in identifying
   the marks made by various species on different matrices. Although rodent
   bite marks have been studied in the context of postmortem interference,
   little research has used different baits to analyze these marks linking
   not only specific behavior patterns but also the possibility of
   structural damage. Twenty mice (Mus musculus) were exposed to different
   baits to study their bite marks in a controlled model. The known pattern
   of parallel and multiple grooves has been seen in all baits, but
   polyvinyl chloride and fiber-optic cable were significantly different
   between each other and the other baits. Some baits showed patterns of
   anchorage of the upper incisors and space between the lower incisors
   when gnawing. This technical note represents a novel model of analysis
   where veterinarians and/or dentists may be asked to give an opinion on
   alleged animal bite marks.}},

Title = {{Histopathological study of cardiac lesions in methamphetamine
   poisoning-related deaths}},
Journal = {{DARU-JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Methamphetamine abuse is a worldwide health concern.
   Methamphetamine causes health hazards in many vital organs. It can cause
   damage to cardiac tissue via catecholamines release. Methamphetamine
   related deaths are becoming one of the most important problems in Iran.
   The purpose of the present study was to determine cardiac pathology in
   methamphetamine poisoning-related deaths.
   Methods: The study included 100 cases of methamphetamine
   poisoning-related deaths and 100 cases as control group. Toxicology
   analysis of liver, gastric content, bile, urine, blood and vitreous
   humor were conducted to detect drugs, poisons and alcohols using thin
   layer chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and high
   performance liquid chromatography. Positive toxicology analysis results
   except for amphetamine and methamphetamine were excluded from the study
   in order to omit interfering factors. The most striking features of
   cardiac damage were observed by light microscopy.
   Results: Methamphetamine and amphetamine were detected in either urine
   or gastric content samples. In all of the cases methamphetamine toxicity
   was determined to be a direct cause of death by forensic medicine
   practitioner. Cardiovascular pathology was noted in 68\% of studied
   cases. The most common histopathologic features were myocardial fiber
   hypertrophy, mild, moderate to severe atherosclerosis and focal
   degeneration/necrosis.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that
   cardiotoxicity is one of the major contributing factors in
   methamphetamine poisoning related deaths. Overall, the current study
   highlights the fact that cardiotoxic effects of methamphetamine can
   explain increasing reports of heart failure and consequently death in
   young abusers.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fibers are the basic unit of textile, and fiber dyes are the colored
   substances that have affinity for fibers and are able to absorb and
   reflect certain visible wavelengths of light. The analysis of fiber dyes
   is extremely important in many fields, such as textile industry,
   environmental protection, forensic science and antiquarian research.
   However, it is challenging to analyze the fiber dyes because of the
   extremely small sample sizes, the desire for nondestructive techniques,
   and the vast complexity of modern dye compositions. Nevertheless,
   significant amount of researches have been done to build new methods and
   techniques for efficient, sensitive and nondestructive fiber dye
   analysis. Those methods can be divided into three categories:
   spectroscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry. The combination of
   chromatography and mass spectrometry, especially the development of soft
   ionization mass spectrometry, makes the detection of trace dyes in a
   complex fiber matrices become easier to implement. In this paper, the
   classification and characteristics of fiber dyes are summarized briefly,
   and the analytical methods and the latest progress for the determination
   of fiber dyes in recent years are reviewed. The challenge of fiber dye
   analysis is also discussed, hoping to provide some references to develop
   new methods and techniques.}},

Title = {{Broad-Scale Genetic Diversity of Cannabis for Forensic Applications}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Cannabis (hemp and marijuana) is an iconic yet controversial crop. On
   the one hand, it represents a growing market for pharmaceutical and
   agricultural sectors. On the other hand, plants synthesizing the
   psychoactive THC produce the most widespread illicit drug in the world.
   Yet, the difficulty to reliably distinguish between Cannabis varieties
   based on morphological or biochemical criteria impedes the development
   of promising industrial programs and hinders the fight against
   narcotrafficking. Genetics offers an appropriate alternative to
   characterize drug vs. non-drug Cannabis. However, forensic applications
   require rapid and affordable genotyping of informative and reliable
   molecular markers for which a broad-scale reference database,
   representing both intra-and inter-variety variation, is available. Here
   we provide such a resource for Cannabis, by genotyping 13 microsatellite
   loci (STRs) in 1 324 samples selected specifically for fibre (24 hemp
   varieties) and drug (15 marijuana varieties) production. We showed that
   these loci are sufficient to capture most of the genomewide diversity
   patterns recently revealed by NGS data. We recovered strong genetic
   structure between marijuana and hemp and demonstrated that anonymous
   samples can be confidently assigned to either plant types. Fibres appear
   genetically homogeneous whereas drugs show low (often clonal) diversity
   within varieties, but very high genetic differentiation between them,
   likely resulting from breeding practices. Based on an additional test
   dataset including samples from 41 local police seizures, we showed that
   the genetic signature of marijuana cultivars could be used to trace
   crime scene evidence. To date, our study provides the most comprehensive
   genetic resource for Cannabis forensics worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a highly selective, specific and efficient method
   for simultaneous determination of ephedrine and methamphetamine by a new
   carbon coated magnetic nanoparticles (C/MNPs) as a magnetic solid phase
   extraction (MSPE) adsorbent in biological urine medium. The
   characterization of synthesized magnetic nano adsorbent was completely
   carried out by various characterization techniques like Fourier
   transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, powder x-ray diffraction (XRD),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and vibrating sample magnetometer
   (VSM). Nine important parameters influencing extraction efficiency
   including amount of adsorbent, amounts of sample volume, pH, type and
   amount of extraction organic solvent, time of extraction and desorption,
   agitation rate and ionic strength of extraction medium, were studied and
   optimized. Under optimized extraction conditions, a good linearity was
   observed in the concentration range of 100-2000 ng/mL for ephedrine and
   100-2500 ng/mL for methamphetamine. Analysis of positive urine samples
   was carried out by proposed method with the recovery of 98.71 and
   97.87\% for ephedrine and methamphetamine, respectively. The results
   indicated that carbon coated magnetic nanoparticles could be applied in
   clinical and forensic laboratories for simultaneous determination of
   abused drugs in urine media. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective comparison of complex signals in chemistry, and more
   particularly in forensic chemistry, with the view of inferring the
   source of a particular `trace' object is an ongoing issue. In this
   paper, we propose a method that enables to assign a probability
   distribution to control material from any given source based on its
   chemical signal and to subsequently infer the source of a trace object
   using a simple Bayes classifier. Our method takes advantage of the
   dimension reduction and discriminative powers of kernels, and only
   requires the estimation of three parameters (once a kernel is chosen).
   We illustrate the application of our method to the inference of the
   source of trace objects based on very small particles (VSP) that can be
   found on their surfaces. VSPs are picked up in the environment(s) where
   the trace object has been in. These VSPs can (1) offer information about
   the geographic origins of the objects; (2) help discriminate between
   multiple mass-manufactured objects that would be otherwise identical. In
   this project, we use VSPs recovered from carpet fibers throughout the
   United States and apply our method to (1) reduce the complexity of
   compositional data obtained by SEM/EDS; (2) infer the source of the
   trace material. This method can be extended to VSPs found on other types
   of recovered forensic materials such as weapons, drugs, or IEDs
   (improvised explosive device), and to other types of chemical signals.}},

Abstract = {{Taphonomic processes affecting bone post mortem are important in
   forensic, archaeological and palaeontological investigations. In this
   study, the application of tissue microarray (TMA) analysis to a sample
   of femoral bone specimens from 20 exhumed individuals of known period of
   burial and age at death is described. TMA allows multiplexing of
   subsamples, permitting standardized comparative analysis of adjacent
   sections in 3-D and of representative cross-sections of a large number
   of specimens. Standard hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff and
   silver methenamine, and picrosirius red staining, and CD31 and CD34
   immunohistochemistry were applied to TMA sections. Osteocyte and
   osteocyte lacuna counts, percent bone matrix loss, and fungal spheroid
   element counts could be measured and collagen fibre bundles observed in
   all specimens. Decalcification with 7\% nitric acid proceeded more
   rapidly than with 0.5 M EDTA and may offer better preservation of
   histological and cellular structure. No endothelial cells could be
   detected using CD31 and CD34 immunohistochemistry. Correlation between
   osteocytes per lacuna and age at death may reflect reported age-related
   responses to microdamage. Methodological limitations and caveats, and
   results of the TMA analysis of post mortem diagenesis in bone are
   discussed, and implications for DNA survival and recovery considered.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades we have observed the industry development and
   increased use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) for pipeline
   rehabilitation. The design of the CFRP rehabilitation was evolving with
   each project and providing municipalities with better designs and more
   confidence in the technology. As with any development process, there are
   many parameters, many tests and various opinions that come together in a
   dynamic way. The goal, or target, is to develop a design and detailing
   consensus that is validated by testing and accepted by the engineering
   community. At the time this paper was submitted, there is still no
   adopted standard for the most commonly detailed CFRP repairs (AWWA C305
   is in the final stage of development). However, these systems have been
   designed and installed on many pipelines over the last 20-years while
   the design philosophy and related detailing has been changing. It has
   been during this time period that the target has truly been moving.
   A recent forensic study of a 96-inch section of PCCP provided a rare
   opportunity to look at an older version of the ``state of the art{''}
   and compare the design and detailing to other methods currently being
   employed. The forensic analysis was focused on identifying the root
   cause of a leak, while also investigating all aspects of the CFRP
   material and the installation. This unique opportunity allowed the team
   to review the past and current analysis methods and detailing, and the
   various testing programs and previous work that has been used to develop
   both the industry and the new AWWA standard for CFRP renewal of PCCP.
   This paper will review the forensic analysis and the critical findings
   that led to the remedial measures and a heightened awareness and
   confidence in the current ``state of the art{''}.}},

Title = {{Age Estimation by Using Aspartic Acid Racemization from Purified Elastin

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{170-178}},
Abstract = {{Age estimation is the one of biological profiles which plays an
   important role in identification in forensic field. The application of
   biochemical approach known as aspartic acid racemization in human
   provides more accuracy and less error of estimated age in age
   determination. During aging, amino acids within protein transform
   between D-and L-form (racemization), which results in increasing
   concentration of D-amino acids. This change of amino acids is related to
   aging. Aspartic acid has been generally applied in racemization because
   it has fastest rate of racemization. Racemization of aspartic acid not
   only takes place in teeth and many kinds of bone, but also can occur in
   the flexible structure which contain mostly elastin. For example, skin
   yellow ligament, lung parenchyma, and aorta. Elastin is essential
   protein which is comprised most composition of several structures and it
   is major content in the elastic fibers. Additionally, elastin is the
   longest lasting protein in the body with slow metabolic turnover rate.
   Recently, there is a purification technique to obtain only single
   protein in human aorta. There was a good correlation between degree of
   racemization (D/L ratio) and age. Therefore, aspartic acid racemization
   by purifies elastin from aorta is a one of indicator for age estimation.
   This review provides an overview of aspartic acid racemization, elastin
   protein, purification method bases on racemization and the application
   of D/L ratio by purified of elastin in artery for age estimation.}},

Abstract = {{New methods aimed at extraction and identification of contaminants and
   trace compounds are critical for a number of technological areas that
   greatly impact our society. Current methods to extract bulk or trace
   compounds from various sources often use volatile organic compounds or
   exhaustive treatment processes that also tend to destroy important
   chemical signatures needed for identification of contaminants. We have
   utilized ionic liquid extractants that are non-toxic and non-flammable,
   and that can quantitatively remove dissolved organic and inorganic
   contaminants from aqueous systems and solids. Additionally, complete
   recovery of trace analytes can be immediately followed by isolation and
   identification through standard analytical methods. The versatility of
   these new liquid extractants therefore provides a high-yielding recovery
   and single-pot approach to enhance identification of water contaminants
   and aid in forensic investigation.}},

Journal = {{PALYNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{203-206}},
Abstract = {{Forensic palynology (the use in civil and criminal investigations of
   spores, pollen and other microscopic entities found on pollen slides)
   can be used in many different contexts. Over the past 10 years, forensic
   palynology has been used to identify the origin of falsified (i.e.
   counterfeit) life-saving pharmaceuticals, particularly antimalarials.
   Counterfeit antimalarial pharmaceuticals in both tablet and liquid form
   have been picked up throughout Southeast Asia and increasingly through
   Africa, resulting in massive loss of life. A wide range of spores,
   pollen, fibres, charcoal, black specks, insect remains, fungal spores
   and hyphae, etc. have been found in the tablets. The amount recovered
   has decreased over time, with increased sophistication of the
   counterfeiting as the perpetrators increase income and can afford more
   specialised equipment. Research, with forensic palynology forming just
   one aspect, suggests that many of the pharmaceuticals that could be
   sourced came from the border areas of China with Vietnam, Lao People's
   Democratic Republic (LPDR), Thailand and Myanmar (Burma).}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Forensic dentistry is a branch of dentistry which in
   collaboration with legal profession serves an important role to maintain
   justice system of a country. Forensic dentists play a major role in
   identification of an individual. Within the literature various methods
   have been found to be useful in gender differentiation. An attempt was
   made for differentiation of gender using picrosirius red and
   polarization microscopy.
   Aim: To evaluate picrosirius red and polarization microscopy as a tool
   for gender differentiation by observing birefringence pattern and
   distribution of thick and thin collagen fibers in males and females.
   Materials and Methods: Labial mucosal tissue obtained from 30 deceased
   individuals (18 male and 12 female) during autopsy was fixed in 10\%
   formalin at 12th hour. Tissue was processed, sectioned and stained using
   picrosirius red stain and the birefringence pattern of collagen fibers
   were studied with polarization microscope. The results were
   statistically analyzed using Z-test and one-way ANOVA to draw the
   significance.
   Results: The proportion of thick and thin fibres among males and females
   were compared. It was found that there was statistically significant
   difference in proportion of thick and thin fibers between male and
   female. Thick fibres in males were (78.13\%) more than females (65.74\%)
   and thin fibres were more in females (34.24\%) than males (21.32\%).
   Conclusion: Picrosirius red and polarization microscopy may be used as a
   tool for gender differentiation. Yet the manner of death has to be
   considered during gender differentiation using this method, as in the
   present study out of 30 cases studied three cases of death due to
   debilitating diseases and poison consumption showed altered collagen
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The fibre traces on a young victim found underwater were mostly single
   fibre traces besides small amounts of fibre collectives
   indistinguishable from his parents clothes (mainly wool). Most of those
   single fibre traces were blue-grey polyester fibres showing tiny
   differences among each other. They were unexpected according to known
   population fibre studies. One year after the victim's discovery
   experiments were conducted to evaluate the possible contamination with
   fibres from river water. A small amount of extraneous fibres were
   collected among which blue and grey-black cotton and man-made (mainly
   polyester) fibres. All man-made fibres were single fibre traces and
   small fibre collectives were only observed for cotton. These results
   confirmed the frequent occurrence of blue and grey-black cotton fibres
   as background, but also highlighted the possible contamination with
   single blue and grey-black man-made fibres from river water. No wool was
   found, strengthening the significance of the wool fibre collectives
   present on the victim. (C) 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic

Title = {{Rapid identification of drug-type strains in Cannabis sativa using
   loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{86-95}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In Cannabis sativa L., tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary
   psychoactive compound and exists as the carboxylated form,
   tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA). C. sativa is divided into two
   strains based on THCA content-THCA-rich (drug-type) strains and
   THCA-poor (fiber-type) strains. Both strains are prohibited by law in
   many countries including Japan, whereas the drug-type strains are
   regulated in Canada and some European countries. As the two strains
   cannot be discriminated by morphological analysis, a simple method for
   identifying the drug-type strains is required for quality control in
   legal cultivation and forensic investigation. We have developed a novel
   loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for identifying the
   drug-type strains of C. sativa. We designed two selective LAMP primer
   sets for on-site or laboratory use, which target the drug-type THCA
   synthase gene. The LAMP assay was accomplished within approximately 40
   min. The assay showed high specificity for the drug-type strains and its
   sensitivity was the same as or higher than that of conventional
   polymerase chain reaction. We also showed the effectiveness of melting
   curve analysis that was conducted after the LAMP assay. The melting
   temperature values of the drug-type strains corresponded to those of the
   cloned drug-type THCA synthase gene, and were clearly different from
   those of the cloned fiber-type THCA synthase gene. Moreover, the LAMP
   assay with simple sample preparation could be accomplished within 1 h
   from sample treatment to identification without the need for special
   devices or techniques. Our rapid, sensitive, specific, and simple assay
   is expected to be applicable to laboratory and on-site detection.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofibers are known for their exceptional surface area and wide
   opportunities for their functionalization. These properties have been
   attractive for various sensor applications, however, mostly electric
   sensing principles have been reported.
   In this paper, a novel approach based on optical detection will be
   described. Various functionalized nanofiber materials have been used to
   demonstrate feasibility of realization of miniature sensors of
   biomedical and chemical values (enzymes reactions, metal ions content,
   etc.). Compactness and sensitivity of the sensors are significantly

Title = {{Application of forensic photography for the detection and mapping of

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Two of the oldest synthetically produced and most widespread pigments
   employed in the decoration of ancient polychrome artifacts are Egyptian
   blue, a vitreous blue compound, and madder lake, a hybrid
   organic-inorganic composite. Both of these pigments are known to be
   photoluminescent after electronic excitation by photons in the visible
   and re-emission of photons in the near infrared (NIR) and visible (Vis)
   respectively. The emissions of Egyptian blue are typically due to d-d
   electronic bands and for madder lake generally due to pi-pi{*} type
   transitions. In this research, the photophysical properties of these two
   pigments were examined by means of forensic photography. The usefulness
   of this type of imaging is based on the properties of Egyptian blue and
   madder lake in exhibiting characteristic near infrared and visible
   emissions when excited by red and green light respectively providing
   reliable fingerprint markers for their identification and mapping. To
   probe and capture the characteristic excitation and emission photon
   energies of Egyptian blue and madder lake an alternate light source
   (ALS) and a modified digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera with
   suitable optical filters were employed in the examination and analysis
   of two Canosa polychrome terracotta vases from the J. Paul Getty Museum
   collection dated to the third century BCE. Reference materials and
   supplementary analysis by fiber optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS)
   and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy were used for verification.

Title = {{Loss and replacement of small particles on the contact surfaces of
   footwear during successive exposures}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{269}},
Pages = {{78-88}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{On the contact surfaces of footwear loosely, moderately and strongly
   held particle fractions were separated and analyzed in an effort to
   detect different particle signals.
   Three environmental exposure sites were chosen to have different,
   characteristic particle types (soil minerals). Shoes of two types (work
   boots and tennis shoes) were tested, accumulating particles by walking
   250 m in each environment. Some shoes were exposed to only one
   environment; others were exposed to all three, in one of six different
   sequences.
   Sampling methods were developed to separate particles from the contact
   surface of the shoe based on how tightly they were held to the sole.
   Loosely held particles were removed by walking on paper, moderately held
   particles were removed by electrostatic lifting, and the most tightly
   held particles were removed by moist swabbing.
   The resulting numbers and types of particles were determined using
   forensic microscopy. Particle profiles from the different fractions were
   compared to test the ability to objectively distinguish the order of
   exposure to the three environments.
   Without exception, the samples resulting from differential sampling are
   dominated by the third site in the sequential footwear exposures. No
   noticeable differences are seen among the differential samplings of the
   loosely, moderately and strongly held particles: the same overwhelming
   presence of the third site is seen. It is clear from these results (1)
   that the third (final) exposure results in the nearly complete removal
   of any particles from prior exposures, and (2) that under the
   experimental conditions loosely, moderately and strongly held particles
   are affected similarly, without any detectable enrichment of the earlier
   exposures among the more tightly held particles.
   These findings have significant implications for casework, demonstrating
   that particles on the contact surfaces of footwear are rapidly lost and
   replaced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mapping the morphological and nano-mechanical properties of cellulose
   fibers within paper sheets or textile products at the nano-scale level
   by using atomic force microscopy is a challenging task due to the huge
   surface level variation of these materials. However this task is
   fundamental for applications in forensic or cultural heritage sciences
   and for the industrial characterization of materials. In order to
   correlate between nano-mechanical properties and local nanometer scale
   morphology of different layers of cellulose fibers, a new strategy to
   prepare samples of isolated cellulose fibers was designed. This approach
   is based on immobilizing isolated fibers onto glass slides chemically
   pretreated so as to promote cellulose adhesion. The experiments
   presented here aim at the nano-scale characterization of fibers in paper
   samples aged under different external agents (relative humidity,
   temperature) in such a way as to promote hydrolysis and oxidation of
   polymers. The observed variability of local mechanical properties of
   paper fibers was related to varying degrees of cellulose polymerization
   induced by artificial aging. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Perfumes are widely used by many people in developed countries, and a
   large number of both men and women wear perfumes on a daily basis.
   Analysis of perfume trace materials from clothing is not commonly
   employed within forensic casework, yet as a form of trace evidence it
   has the potential to provide valuable intelligence. In order to
   appreciate the value of trace evidence there is a fundamental need for
   an evidence base that can both offer insight into how a trace material
   behaves under different scenarios and activities, and from which
   inferences can be made. With this purpose a gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry method for trace analysis of perfumes was developed. This
   paper presents two different series of experiments that investigate the
   dynamics of perfume transfer as a factor of perfume ageing time, and as
   a factor of perfume contact time. Empirical data showed that both
   perfume ageing time, and perfume contact time play a key role in the
   number of perfume components transferred. These studies have implication
   for forensic protocols, specifically for perfume trace evidence
   collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation, and there is
   potentially great value in analysing perfumes from clothing exhibits in
   forensic enquiries that involve close contact between individuals, such
   as sexual assaults. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Microspectrophotometry followed by chemometric data analysis was
   conducted on pairs of visually similar blue acrylic fibers, simulating
   the ``questioned versus known{''} scenarios often encountered in
   forensic casework. The relative similarity or dissimilarity of each pair
   was determined by employing principal component analysis, discriminant
   analysis and Fisher's exact test. Comparison of fibers from within each
   set resulted in a correct inclusion result in 10 out of 11 scenarios,
   with the one false exclusion attributed to a lack of reproducibility in
   the spectra. Comparison of fibers from different sets resulted in a
   correct exclusion result in 108 of 110 scenarios, with two sets that
   shared identical dye combinations being indistinguishable. Although the
   presented methods are not infallible, they may nonetheless provide a
   path forward for forensic fiber examiners that has a more scientifically
   rigorous basis on which to support their findings in a court of law. (C)

Abstract = {{An important aspect of any crime scene investigation is to detect,
   secure and analyze trace evidence. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a
   nanotechnology that can be used to generate forensic information. This
   review aims to briefly explain principles of AFM and review potential
   forensic applications like age determination of bloodstains, fingermark
   examination, investigation of textile fibers, document forgery
   detection, gunshot and explosive residues analysis, and pressure
   sensitive adhesives investigation. Current techniques are highlighted
   and the usefulness of AFM is discussed. For the examination of gunshot,
   explosives and pressure sensitive adhesive residues AFM can determine
   elastic moduli, adhesion forces, energy dissipation, and dielectric
   properties of trace material, provide synoptic mapping of these
   characteristics and identify compositions. Phase imaging and force
   spectroscopy are important options but cannot unravel chemical
   identities. Forensic relevance of force spectroscopy for red blood cell
   age estimation is promising but remains to be fully explored. If not
   affected by surface roughness AFM height imaging may yield complementary
   information with respect to fingermark, textile and document
   examinations. For overlapping, (partially) erased marks or mixtures of
   biological traces phase imaging could provide composition information.
   If the chemical identity of trace components is important AFM may be
   combined with (surface/tip enhanced) Raman spectroscopy. Equipped with
   high resolution optical microscopy AFM(-Raman) technology may become a
   valuable forensic tool to characterize and understand trace transfer and
   persistence and to assess condition and age of evidence material. AFM
   could thus yield additional options for forensic association and assist
   in forensic analysis at activity level. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Trace fibers are an important form of trace evidence, and identification
   of exogenous substances on textile fibers provides valuable information
   about the origin of the fiber. Laundering textiles can provide a unique
   fluorescent spectral signature of the whitening agent in the detergent
   that adsorbs to the fiber. Using fluorescence microscopy, the spectral
   characteristics of seven detergents adsorbed to single fibers drawn from
   laundered textiles were investigated, and principal component analysis
   of clusters was used to characterize the type of detergent on the fiber.
   On dyed nylon fibers, spectra from eight different detergent pairs could
   be resolved and washed validation fibers correctly classified. On dyed
   acrylic fibers, five different detergent pairs could be resolved and
   identified. Identification of the detergent type may prove useful in
   matching a trace fiber to its bulk specimen of origin.}},

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{268}},
Pages = {{139-144}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The characterization and identification of dyes in fibers can be used to
   provide investigative leads and strengthen associations between known
   and questioned items of evidence. The isolation of a dye from its matrix
   (e.g., a textile fiber) permits detailed characterization, comparison
   and, in some cases, identification using methods such as thin layer
   chromatography in conjunction with infrared and Raman spectroscopy. A
   survey of dye extraction publications reveals that pyridine: water (4:3)
   is among the most commonly cited extraction solvent across a range of
   fiber and dye chemistries. Here, the efficacy of this solvent system has
   been evaluated for the extraction of dyes from 172 commercially
   prevalent North American textile dyes. The evaluated population
   represents seven dye application classes, 18 chemical classes, and spans
   nine types of commercial textile fibers. The results of this survey
   indicate that similar to 82\% of the dyestuffs studied are extractable
   using this solvent system. The results presented here summarize the
   extraction efficacy by class and fiber type and illustrate that this
   solvent system is applicable to a wider variety of classes and fibers
   than previously indicated in the literature. While there is no universal
   solvent for fiber extraction, these results demonstrate that pyridine:
   water represents an excellent first step for extracting unknown dyes
   from questioned fibers in forensic casework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to assess the human bioaccessibility of dust
   contaminated with hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) via two migration
   pathways a) volatilisation with subsequent partitioning to dust
   particles, and b) abrasion of treated textile fibres directly to the
   dust. This was achieved using previously developed experimental chamber
   designs to generate dust samples contaminated with HBCDs emitted from a
   HBCD treated textile curtain. The generated dust samples were exposed to
   an in vitro colon extended physiologically based extraction test
   (CE-PBET). The bioaccessibility of the HBCDs which were incorporated
   within dust as a result of volatilisation from the curtain material with
   subsequent partitioning to dust was higher than in dusts contaminated
   with HBCDs via abrasion of the curtain (35\% and 15\% respectively). We
   propose this occurs due to a stronger binding of HBCDs to treated fabric
   fibres than that experienced following volatilisation and sorption of
   HBCDs to dust particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of organic dyes is a challenging task in all the
   fields such as the forensic and conservation sciences, especially in
   cases where the amount of sample is extremely small. In this paper we
   propose a new enhanced FTIR method (MU-ATR metal underlayer ATR
   spectroscopy), which we believe is the first of its kind, for the
   analysis of a few ng of dyes. With this method, dyed fiber
   micro-extracts can be analyzed using a commercial FTIR microscope with a
   fixed incident angle, obtaining the same separation between the
   different classes of dyes investigated as we obtained analyzing pure
   dyes in transmission mode.
   Moreover, the new enhancement method has been validated on a real sample
   dated back to the 1893, showing how it can be promising for the analysis
   of trace amounts of organic substances in artistic samples such as dyes
   in paintings or textiles, varnishes and organic residues on
   archaeological objects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{,A carbon fiber ionization (CFI) technique was developed for the mass
   spectrometric analysis of various organic compounds with different
   polarities. The design of the CFI technique was based on the good
   compatibility and dispersion of samples and solutions in different
   solvents on carbon fiber. As a fast, convenient, and versatile
   ionization method, CFI-MS is especially efficient for analyzing many
   low/nonpolar organic compounds, such as polycyclic, aromatic
   hydrocarbons, long chain aliphatic aldehydes, sensitive steroids,
   terpenoids, and organometallic compounds. Some of these compounds;may
   not be well-analyzed by electrospray ionization or electron ionization
   mass spectrometry. On the basis of our experimental results; the major
   ion formation mechanism of CFI-MS was suggested to involve desorption in
   a steam-distillation-like process, and then, ionization occurred mainly
   via corona discharge under high voltage. CFI-MS cold not only work alone
   but also be coupled with separation techniques. It works well when
   coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) as well as in the
   analysis of exhaled human air. The high flexibility and versatility of
   CFI-MS has extended its applications in many areas, such as fast
   chemical screening, clinical testing, and forensic analysis.}},

   determined in this study (15 mM borate buffer, pH 10.50, separation
   voltage 24 kV), neodymium could be separated effectively from the
   neighboring lanthanides (praseodymium and samarium) within several
   minutes, and the limit of detection for neodymium is estimated to be at
   the ppt level. The ICFO-LIF-CE system assembled in this study exhibits
   unique performance characteristics such as low cost and flexibility.
   Meanwhile, the separation efficiency and detection sensitivity of the
   assembled CE system are comparable to or somewhat better than those
   obtained in the previous traditional CE systems, indicating the

Title = {{Can ``contamination{''} occur in body bags?-The example of background
   fibres in body bags used in Australia}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{266}},
Pages = {{517-526}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Impurities that are transferred to a crime scene or a body can have a
   significant negative impact on the investigation if the existence of the
   contamination is not known, and the source of the contamination is not
   identified. Forensic consumables, such as DNA swabs, have been known to
   have caused contaminations, wrongfully linking crimes throughout Europe.
   In that context, this study focused on body bags, widely used to
   transfer a corpse from the crime scene to the morgue. Our preliminary
   survey showed that several countries and Australian Jurisdictions are
   conducting the sampling of trace evidence at the morgue after the
   transportation of the body. Potential impurities present in body bags
   could thus interfere with pertinent traces.
   The aim of this work was to qualify and quantify the background
   contamination of trace evidence in body bags used within Australia.
   Fifteen body bags from four Australian Jurisdictions or laboratories
   were searched for micro traces. Impurities such as fibres and
   unidentified particles were detected in each examined body bag, with an
   estimated average of 3603 coloured fibres and 1429 unidentified
   particles. This number of fibres is similar to the amount found on a
   vinyl cinema seat in other studies. Various other contaminants such as
   pieces of fabric, hairs, parts of insects or feathers were also
   observed. It is hypothesised that these impurities are introduced during
   the manufacturing process.
   This high number of impurities can lead to incorrect conclusions and
   misleading investigative leads. This paper presents an overview of the
   problems these impurities can cause and proposes several strategies to
   prevent future issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the process of evidence identification, detecting chemical
   composition of evidence with instrumental analysis techniques will help
   get more information relevant to the case quickly and accurately, while
   the commonly used techniques are chromatography, mass spectrometry and
   spectroscopy techniques. Forensic science laboratory relates to the
   identification of evidence from a wide range of complex situations, we
   need to decide what kind of analytical methods according to the type of
   physical evidence and instrument characteristics. For example, with the
   advantages of high resolution, high sensitivity, and strong ability to
   analysis; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is often used to detect
   evidence of fire scene such as flammable liquids. The more common
   scenarios of the application in forensic science laboratory is related
   to the case of various organic certificate (ink, paint, plastic, etc.)
   and inorganic (mineral, inorganic fillers, etc.) for quick and efficient
   analysis. Infrared spectroscopy is one of the most effective
   conventional analysis methods to identify and determine the molecular
   structure of the compound, whihc is especially widely used in the field
   of forensic science evidence identification. The infrared spectroscopy
   technique can be used to determine the type of evidence, which also
   serves as an effective means of test; the test results can offer
   evidence to the court to settle a lawsuit. This paper reviewed the
   application status and latest research advances of infrared spectroscopy
   technique in forensic document examination, oil test, plastic test,
   paint inspection, fiber inspection, common areas of drugs and other
   evidence examination, and prospected infrared spectroscopy technology in
   the field of evidence identification, from a practical point of view to
   provide infrared spectroscopy research profile for the scientific
   research personnel.}},

Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},

Abstract = {{Detailed morphological and anatomical descriptions and photographs of
   the bark and wood of Prunus africana are provided for future use in
   taxonomic, phylogenetic, forensic and pharmacognostic studies. The bark
   is used in African traditional medicine and has become an important raw
   material for commercial extracts to treat benign prostate hyperplasia.
   Anatomical characters of diagnostic importance include parenchyma cells
   in the non-conducting part of the phloem with a reddish-brown content,
   abundance of druse crystals, scanty fibre-like sclereids and fibres
   (both of them solitary or arranged in groups of two to 15), and shape
   and position of rays in the dilated secondary phloem. The large number
   of sieve areas (four to 23) in the compound sieve plates appears to be a
   unique character-all other species have three to 10 sieve plates. The
   long sieve tube members (230-600 mu m) differ from those of other Prunus
   species (typically 80-375 mu m). P. africana is compared with other
   species of Prunus, and shares with them wood with distinct growth rings,
   vessels that are solitary or in radial multiples and clusters,
   perforation plates that are simple, the walls of vessel elements with
   helical thickenings, diffuse axial parenchyma and ray cells having a
   reddish-brown content or druse crystals. The loss of distinctive borders
   in the pits, as found also in P. davidiana and P. persica, was also
   observed in P. africana. P. africana shares with a small group of other
   species the scanty amount of fibre-like sclereids and fibres in the
   bark. (C) 2016 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the successful use of direct PCR amplification of single
   fibers from items of worn clothing. Items of clothing were worn
   throughout the course of a day, with the individual commencing regular
   activities. Single fibers were taken from the cuff of the clothing at
   regular intervals and amplified directly. The same areas were subjected
   to tape-lifting, and also amplified directly for comparison. The NGM
   (TM) kit that amplifies 15 STR loci plus amelogenin was used. A total of
   35 single fiber samples were processed and analyzed from five items of
   clothing, with 81 \% of samples returning a profile of 14 alleles or
   more. All tape-lift samples amplified directly produced DNA profiles of
   15 alleles or more. The aim was to develop a simple, operational method
   that could be used routinely in forensic science casework and that has
   the potential to generate more complete profiles, which would not be
   detected using standard extraction methods on this type of sample. For
   ease of implementation, the process also adheres to standard methods
   with no increase in the cycle number.}},

Abstract = {{European expansion in the Atlantic in the Late Middle Ages often implied
   the use of violence, involving tactics and weaponry unknown to some of
   the affected populations. Among the first places to suffer this violence
   were the Canary Islands, whose conquest lasted the whole of the 15th
   century. Documentary information about this historical episode is
   abundant, whereas archaeological evidence testifying to it is very rare.
   However, an individual from an indigenous funerary context of Gran
   Canaria (placed in a collective burial cave and wrapped in a shroud made
   of vegetable fibres) displays a large number of wounds, both on his
   skull and on the rest of the skeleton, probably caused by swords,
   suggesting a mortal attack conducted by one or more aggressors. Based on
   the study of injuries, it is considered a potential explanation of their
   origin, concluding that most likely this case may be associated with the
   process of the conquest of the Island. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The presented study was dedicated to the comparison between wool and
   polyamide fibres, dyed with metal-complex (gryfalan) dyes being
   analogous regarding type and concentration, with the use of UV-Vis
   microspectrophotometry. The affinity of used dyes to the particular
   fibre type as well as the influence of fibre polymer on the quality of
   spectra obtained were subjected to evaluation. The absorbance spectra,
   obtained with the use of a 20/20 PV (TM) microspectrophotometer (CRAIC
   Technologies) for single fibres selected from 15 woolen and 15 polyamide
   fabrics, were studied. The results indicated that at the same
   concentration of dye, the dyes' affinity is higher for polyamide fibres
   than for wool. Thus, the conduction of the examination of single wool
   fibres in the visible and in the UV-A range can be recommended, and in
   the case of analysing fibres with similar microscopic colour, the
   chemometric treatment seems to be an effective way of discrimination.

Abstract = {{Hair diameter and curvature are two characteristics of human scalp hair
   used in forensic contexts. While previous data show that subjective
   categorization of hair curvature is highly heritable, the heritability
   of objectively measured curvature and diameter, and variability of hair
   characteristics within each individual have not yet been studied. The
   present study measured hair diameter and curvature using an optical
   fiber diameter analyzer in a sample of 2,332 twins and siblings.
   Heritability was estimated using maximum likelihood structural equation
   modeling. Results show sex differences in the magnitude of genetic
   influence for mean diameter and curvature, with the vast majority of the
   variance accounted for by genetic effects in males (diameter = 86\%,
   curvature = 53\%) and females (diameter = 77\%, curvature = 61\%). The
   consistency of diameter (variance within an individual) was also highly
   heritable, but did not show sex limitation, with 68\% of the variance
   accounted for by genetic factors. Moderate phenotypic correlations were
   seen between diameter and consistency (r = 0.3) but there was little
   correlation between diameter and curvature (r = -0.13). A bivariate
   Cholesky analysis was used to estimate the genetic and environmental
   correlations between hair diameter and consistency, yielding genetic
   correlations of r(gF) = 0.27 for females and r(gM) = 0.25 for males.}},

Abstract = {{A new class of ceramic pigments based on orthorhombic Thulium (Tm3+)
   doped YAlO3 nanophosphors are synthesized by a simple and efficient low
   temperature solution combustion method using oxalyl dihydrazide (ODH) as
   fuel. The phosphors exhibit bright blue emission upon 359 nm excitation.
   Judd -Ofelt (J-O) theory is applied to a series of Tm3+ doped phosphors
   based on their emission spectra. CIE chromaticity co-ordinates confirm
   blue emission of the phosphor. The prepared nano-phosphor was successful
   in developing latent fingerprint from various forensic relevant
   materials. A preliminary investigation of their anti-counterfeiting
   performance has been made, and the results indicate that the color
   emitting capability and high concealment makes this nanophosphor can
   provide a strengthened and more reliable anti-counterfeiting effect. As
   a result the optimized YAlO3:Tm3+ (3 mol\%) phosphor is quite useful for
   potential application of pigments of desired color, solid state
   lighting, latent fingerprint, display and anti-counterfeiting
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A silk cross-stitched man's overcoat in traditional Uzbek style in the
   Indianapolis Museum of Art was thought to originate from late 1800s to
   early 1900s. To shed light on its history and associated textile dye
   chemistry, threads from the coat were subjected to dye analysis by
   LC-DAD-ESI-MS. Dyes identified include seventeen natural colorants from
   barberry, larkspur, madder and cochineal, and forty-two synthetic
   compounds in the diazo, xanthene, and triarylmethine class. Many of the
   synthetic dyes were heterogeneous, attributable either to crudeness in
   synthetic process or to age related degradation. The different shades of
   red and green in the threads were obtained from blending two. or three
   synthetic dyes as well as, in one case, the combination of natural and
   synthetic components. Direct Red 23, C.I. 29160, first reported in 1900,
   was the most recent, thus refining the creation date of the garment to
   the early twentieth century or later. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hair and fibers are common forms of trace evidence found at crime
   scenes. The current methodology of microscopic examination of potential
   hair evidence is absent of statistical measures of performance, and
   examiner results for identification can be subjective. Here, attenuated
   total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
   was used to analyze synthetic fibers and natural hairs of human, cat,
   and dog origin. Chemometric analysis was used to differentiate hair
   spectra from the three different species, and to predict unknown hairs
   to their proper species class, with a high degree of certainty. A
   species-specific partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA)
   model was constructed to discriminate human hair from cat and dog hairs.
   This model was successful in distinguishing between the three classes
   and, more importantly, all human samples were correctly predicted as
   human. An external validation resulted in zero false positive and false
   negative assignments for the human class. From a forensic perspective,
   this technique would be complementary to microscopic hair examination,
   and in no way replace it. As such, this methodology is able to provide a
   statistical measure of confidence to the identification of a sample of
   human, cat, and dog hair, which was called for in the 2009 National
   Academy of Sciences report. More importantly, this approach is
   non-destructive, rapid, can provide reliable results, and requires no
   sample preparation, making it of ample importance to the field of
   forensic science.}},

   subjects}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: While standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are
   increasingly employed in post-mortem (PM) examinations, more advanced
   techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain unexplored in
   forensic sciences. Therefore, we studied the temporal stability and
   reproducibility of DTI and fiber tractography (FT) in non-fixed PM
   subjects. In addition, we investigated the lumbosacral nerves with PMDTI
   and compared their tissue characteristics to in vivo findings.
   Methods: MRI data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner in seven PM
   subjects, consisting of six nontrauma deaths and one chronic trauma
   death, and in six living subjects. Inter-scan (within one session) and
   inter-session (between days) reproducibility of diffusion parameters,
   fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were evaluated
   for the lumbosacral nerves using Bland-Altman and Jones plots. Diffusion
   parameters in nerves L3-S2 were compared to living subjects using the
   non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.
   Results: Reproducibility of diffusion values of inter-scan 95\% limits
   of agreement ranged from -0.058 to 0.062 for FA, and (-0.037 to 0.052) x
   10(-3) mm(2)/s for MD. For the inter-session this was -0.0423 to 0.0423,
   and (-0.0442 to 0.0442) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for FA, and MD, respectively.
   Although PM subjects showed approximately four-fold lower diffusivity
   values compared to living subjects, FT results were comparable. The
   chronic trauma case showed disorganization and asymmetry of the nerves.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated that DTI was reproducible in characterizing
   nervous tissue properties and FT in reconstructing the architecture of
   lumbosacral nerves in PM subjects. We showed differences in diffusion
   values between PM and in vivo and showed the ability of PMDTI and FT to
   reconstruct nerve lesions in a chronic trauma case. We expect that PMDTI
   and FT may become valuable in identification and documentation of PM
   nerve trauma or pathologies in forensic sciences. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fleece garments are very popular nowadays. This is reflected in forensic
   fibre cases where fleece garments and especially black colored items are
   frequently encountered. For this study 201 black and dark colored fleece
   garments were collected from co-workers, friends, family and shops. The
   constituent fibres were analyzed with common methods used in forensic
   fibre analyses: microscopy (bright field, polarized light,
   fluorescence); microspectrophotometry (MSP-visible range); infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) and comparison microscopy. Almost all fleece fabrics
   were made of 100\% polyester fibres. The most abundant fibre type
   involved polygonal polyester fibres. The appearance of typical
   fleece-features was explored. It was found that fleece fibres would shed
   easily, resulting in many long polyester fibres. In many cases these
   fleece fibres showed typical ``mushroom-ends{''} and in some cases a few
   thicker fibres that originated from the inner ``base layer{''} of the
   fleece fabric were also found providing a second fibre type that can be
   lost from fleece fabrics.
   Most of the black fleece fabrics could be discriminated with the
   analytical techniques, the discriminating power DP was found to be
   0.9985. This was despite the fact that most of the absorption spectra
   showed similar features in the visible range. They were denominated as
   TYPE 1 MSP-spectra and displayed 2 absorption bands at 450 nm and 600
   nm. (C) 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences. Published by

Abstract = {{ObjectivesNormal human bone tissue changes predictably as adults get
   older, but substantial variability in pattern and pace remains
   unexplained. Information is needed regarding the characteristics of
   histological variables across diverse human populations.
   MethodsUndecalcified thin sections from mid-thoracic ribs of 213
   skeletons (138 M, 75 F, 17-82 years, mean age 48 years), are used to
   explore the efficacy of an established age-at-death estimation method
   and methodological approach (Cho et al.: J Forensic Sci 47 (2002) 12-18)
   and expand on it. The ribs are an age-balanced sample taken from
   skeletonized cadavers collected from 1967 to 1999 in South Africa, each
   with recorded sex, age, cause of death and government-defined population
   group (129 Colored, 49 Black, 35 White).
   ResultsThe Ethnicity Unknown equation performs better than those
   developed for European-Americans and African-Americans, in terms of
   accuracy and bias. A new equation based solely on the study sample does
   not improve accuracy. Osteon population densities (OPD) show predicted
   values, yet secondary osteon areas (On.Ar) are smaller than expected for
   non-Black subgroups. Relative cortical area (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar) is low among
   non-Whites.
   ConclusionsResults from this highly diverse sample show that
   population-specific equations do not increase estimate precision. While
   within the published range of error for the method (+/- 24.44 years),
   results demonstrate a systematic under-aging of young adults and
   over-aging of older adults. The regression approach is inappropriate.
   The field needs fresh approaches to statistical treatment and to factors
   behind cortical bone remodeling. Am J Phys Anthropol 160:137-147, 2016.

   of crimes against the person such as murder and rape. This article
   describes a streamlined and simplified approach for the identification

   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS) that avoids
   fractionation or isolation of proteins. It is applicable to the
   examination of microliter quantities (or less) of neat fluids, extracts
   or suspensions of dried fluids or deposits of fluids in situ on tufts of
   fibers plucked from fabrics, which has practical application in the
   examination of crime-related items such as underwear or face masks.
   Hemoglobin was used as a marker for blood, a.-amylase for saliva,
   semenogelins, prostate-specific antigen and acid phosphatase for seminal
   fluid and uromodulin for urine. Aged stains were successfully analyzed;
   blood proteins were easily detected in an 11-year-old blood stain. (C)

Abstract = {{Fire is one of the most destructive powers to which a building structure
   can be subjected, often exposing concrete elements to elevated
   temperatures. The relative properties of concrete after such an exposure
   are of significant importance in terms of the serviceability of
   buildings. Unraveling the heating history of concrete and different
   cooling regimes is important for forensic research or to determine
   whether a fire-exposed concrete structure and its components are still
   structurally sound or not. Assessment of fire-damaged concrete
   structures usually starts with visual observation of colour change,
   cracking and spalling. Thus, it is important to know the effect of
   elevated temperatures on strength retention properties of concrete. This
   study reports the effect of elevated temperature on the mechanical
   properties of the concrete specimen with polypropylene fibres and cooled
   differently under various regimes. In the heating cycle, the specimen
   were subjected to elevated temperatures ranging from 200 degrees C to
   800 degrees C, in steps of 200 degrees C with a retention period of 1
   hour. Then they were cooled to room temperature differently. The cooling
   regimes studied include, furnace cooling, air cooling and sudden
   cooling. After exposure to elevated temperatures and cooled differently,
   the weight loss, residual compressive and split tensile strengths
   retention characteristics were studied. Test results indicated that
   weight and both compressive and tensile strengths significantly reduce,
   with an increase in temperature and are strongly dependent on cooling
   regimes adopted.}},

   Desorption Electrospray Ionization (IR-MALDESI)}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Ambient ionization sources for mass spectrometry (MS) have been the
   subject of much interest in the past decade. Matrix-assisted laser
   desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI) is an example of such
   methods, where features of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   (MALDI) (e.g., pulsed nature of desorption) and electrospray ionization
   (ESI) (e.g., soft-ionization) are combined. One of the major advantages
   of MALDESI is its inherent versatility. In MALDESI experiments, an
   ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) laser can be used to resonantly excite
   an endogenous or exogenous matrix. The choice of matrix is not analyte
   dependent, and depends solely on the laser wavelength used for
   excitation. In IR-MALDESI experiments, a thin layer of ice is deposited
   on the sample surface as an energy-absorbing matrix. The IR-MALDESI
   source geometry has been optimized using statistical design of
   experiments (DOE) for analysis of liquid samples as well as biological
   tissue specimens. Furthermore, a robust IR-MALDESI imaging source has
   been developed, where a tunable mid-IR laser is synchronized with a
   computer controlled XY translational stage and a high resolving power
   mass spectrometer. A custom graphical user interface (GUI) allows user
   selection of the repetition rate of the laser, number of shots per
   voxel, step-size of the sample stage, and the delay between the
   desorption and scan events for the source. IR-MALDESI has been used in
   variety of applications such as forensic analysis of fibers and dyes and
   MSI of biological tissue sections. Distribution of different analytes
   ranging from endogenous metabolites to exogenous xenobiotics within
   tissue sections can be measured and quantified using this technique. The
   protocol presented in this manuscript describes major steps necessary
   for IR-MALDESI MSI of whole-body tissue sections.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of forensic science, conventional infrared spectral
   analysis technique is usually unable to meet the detection requirements,
   because only very a few trace material evidence with diverse shapes and
   complex compositions, can be extracted from the crime scene. Infrared
   microscopic technique is developed based on a combination of
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic technique and microscopic
   technique. Infrared microscopic technique has a lot of advantages over
   conventional infrared spectroscopic technique, such as high detection
   sensitivity, micro-area analysisand nondestructive examination. It has
   effectively solved the problem of authentication of trace material
   evidence in the field of forensic science. Additionally, almost no
   external interference is introduced during measurements by infrared
   microscopic technique. It can satisfy the special need that the trace
   material evidence must be, reserved for witness in court. It is
   illustrated in detail through real case analysis in this experimental
   center that, infrared microscopic technique has advantages in
   authentication of trace material evidence in forensic science field. In
   this paper, the vibration features in infrared spectra of material
   evidences, including paints, plastics, rubbers, fibers, drugs and
   toxicants, can be comparatively analyzed by means of infrared
   microscopic technique, in an attempt to provide powerful spectroscopic
   evidence for qualitative diagnosis of various criminal and traffic
   accident cases. The experimental results clearly suggest that infrared
   microscopic technique has an incomparable advantage and it has become an
   effective method for authentication of trace material evidence in the
   field of forensic science.}},

Abstract = {{This study discusses the results of an evaluation of a one-part blue
   light-curing acrylic resin for embedding trace evidence prior to the
   preparation of thin sections with a microtome. Through a comparison to

   viscosity, clarity, color, hardness, and cure speed, were explored.
   Finally, thin sections from paint samples embedded in this acrylic resin
   were evaluated to determine if, through smearing or impregnation, the

Abstract = {{Legal limits on the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content in
   Cannabis sativa plants have complicated genetic and forensic studies in
   this species. However, Cannabis seeds present very low THC levels. We
   developed a method for embryo extraction from seeds and an improved
   protocol for DNA extraction and tested this method in four hemp and six
   marijuana varieties. This embryo extraction method enabled the recovery
   of diploid embryos from individual seeds. An improved DNA extraction
   protocol (CTAB3) was used to obtain DNA from individual embryos at a
   concentration and quality similar to DNA extracted from leaves. DNA
   extracted from embryos was used for SSR molecular characterization in
   individuals from the 10 varieties. A unique molecular profile for each
   individual was obtained, and a clear differentiation between hemp and
   marijuana varieties was observed. The combined embryo extraction-DNA
   extraction methodology and the new highly polymorphic SSR markers
   facilitate genetic and forensic studies in Cannabis.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of total excitation-emission fluorescence microscopy
   combined with multiway chemometric analysis was investigated for the
   nondestructive forensic analysis of textile fibers. The four pairs of

   3 and disperse blue 14, polyester 777 dyed with disperse red 1 and
   disperse red 19, and acrylic 864 dyed with basic green 1 and basic green
   4. Excitation emission matrices were recorded with the aid of an
   inverted microscope and a commercial spectrofluorimeter. The full
   information content of excitation emission matrices was processed with
   the aid of unsupervised parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), PARAFAC
   supervised by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and discriminant
   unfolded partial least-squares (DU-PLS). The ability of the latter

Abstract = {{Liquid chromatography/linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC/LIT-MSn) was
   used to construct a database of disperse dyes. Fifty-three standard dyes
   were subjected to LC/LIT-MSn and characterized based on their mass
   spectra (MS, MS2, and MS3), values of lambda(max) (maximum absorption
   wavelength in the UV-visible spectrum), and retention times. The results
   demonstrate that it is possible to reliably identify coexisting dyes
   that cannot be separated by LC or detected by diode array detection due
   to their low molecular absorption coefficients. In addition, the
   by-products included in the standard dyes were found to provide
   important information for the identification and discrimination of
   dyestuffs synthesized using different processes. The confirmation of the
   effectiveness of LC/LIT-MSn analysis in detecting small amounts of
   disperse dyes in this study shows its potential for use in the
   discrimination of dyed fibers obtained at crime scenes.}},

Abstract = {{An important way to determine the authenticity and validity of documents
   is by the sequence of lines. Many factors have been found to determine
   line order by observing the heterogeneous morphological characteristics
   of crossing points. However, to date, few methods have been applied to
   the sequence of laser printing and fountain pen writing without a
   crossing line. The sequence is more difficult to examine if there is no
   intersecting line. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted
   to survey the microscopic shape of ink lines, toner particles and paper
   fibres using a video tomography microscope. Several factors, such as the
   types of ink and laser printer, the difference of writer and the class
   of fountain pen, were analysed to determine whether they might affect
   the formation of characteristics. The final experimental result
   demonstrates that there are many differences among the samples made by
   different sequences. These factors have only a slight effect on the
   examination. After blind testing, it was found that the methodology can
   be applied to determine the sequence of laser printing and fountain pen
   writing.}},

Abstract = {{Trace textile fiber evidence is found at numerous crime scenes and plays
   an important role in linking a suspect to the respective scene. In this
   work, investigations into the fluorescence of fiber dyes and fibers
   themselves, as well as a methodology for discriminating between fibers
   using room temperature fluorescence (RTF) are reported. Initial
   systematic analysis was conducted on dye standards and extracts taken
   from fibers colored with the respective dyes of interest. Absorbance,
   excitation and fluorescence spectra were compared between standards and
   extracts to determine the optimal area of the fiber to investigate dyes,
   fluorescent impurities or the whole fiber. High performance liquid
   chromatography investigations were performed to obtain detailed
   information on the number of dye and fluorescent components present in
   extracts. Three-way Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) data were found to
   give the greatest amount of spectral information and provide the highest
   level of discrimination. Successful discrimination between non-similar
   and similar fibers was achieved with the aid of second order MCR-ALS
   chemometric analysis. The level of discrimination obtained via RTF-EEM
   spectroscopy was sufficient to differentiate among two types of visually
   indistinguishable fibers and among fibers obtained from two separate
   cloths of the same material and colored with the same dye reagent.}},

Abstract = {{Cannabis, both herbal and resin, has been the most popular illicit drug
   in Israel in recent years. Until 2005, the main sources of cannabis
   resin (known also as hashish) to the Israeli drug market were Lebanon
   and India. Hashish from these sources can be distinguished by its
   external appearance. The aim of this study was to determine if there is
   any difference in the quality of the hashish from each source. For this
   purpose, we quantified the main cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD),
   Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), and cannabinol (CBN) of
   hashish from different police seizures of known origins, Lebanon, India
   and Morocco, that had been submitted to the Analytical Chemistry
   Laboratory of the Division of Identification and Forensic Science at the
   Israeli National Police Headquarters and subsequently to the Hebrew
   University for quantitative analysis. The results, based on many
   different seizures, showed that the average CBD content of hashish from
   Lebanon varied from 5.69\% to 12.79\% (an average 8.98 +/- 0.59\%), THC
   of hashish from Lebanon varied from 0.93\% to 4.20\% (an average of 2.38
   +/- 0.27 \%), CBD of hashish from Morocco varied from 1.52\% to 5.14\%
   (an average of 3.72 +/- 0.19\%), THC of hashish from Morocco varied from
   5.08\% to 13.41\% (an average of 9.21 +/- 0.40\%), CBD of hashish from
   India varied from 0.78\% to 13.13\% (an average of 4.59 +/- 1.07\%), and
   THC of hashish from India varied from 0.53\% to 16.45\% (an average of
   6.35 +/- 1.50\%), At the same time, several other cannabinoids present
   in the samples in lower amounts were identified (cannabidivarol, CBDV;
   cannabicitran; Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarol, Delta(9)-THCV;
   cannabivarol, CBV; cannabicyclol, CBL; cannabichromene, CBC;
   cannabielsoin, CBE; Delta(8)-THC; and cannabigerol, CBG). The samples,
   predominantly from Lebanon, Morocco, and India, were evaluated for
   chemical phenotype (drug type and fiber type) to determine the
   geographical origin of these samples.
   Indian hashish, seized by Czech Republic authorities, was analyzed
   qualitatively for many cannabinoids and terpenes. In this sample three
   new cannabinoids were identified: cannabiorcochromene,
   cis-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarol, and cannabinerol.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2002, the 1:1 tape lifting technique on murder victims has been
   introduced in Belgium. Thirty-six murder cases for which a fibre
   examination was carried out in our laboratory between 2002 and 2012 are
   reviewed. These cases all involved the collection of microtraces on 39
   victims using a 1:1 taping or similar technique, called semi 1:1 taping.
   The degree of ``positive outcomes{''} for investigative and comparative
   fibre cases is high. Especially in cases where the modus operandi of
   suspects had to be verified, the examination of the 1:1 tape lifting led
   to very useful fibre results. The findings from some of these fibre
   cases are used to illustrate the advantages, drawbacks and points of
   interest of the two collection techniques. These are also compared with
   the zonal taping technique, another microtrace collection technique
   applied on victims at the crime scene. (C) 2015 The Chartered Society of

Abstract = {{Advances in plant genomics have had an impact on the field of forensic
   botany. However, the use of pollen DNA profiling in forensic
   investigations has yet to be applied. Five volunteers wore a jacket with
   Pinus echinata pollen containing cotton swatches for a 14-day period.
   Pollen decay was evaluated at days 0, 3, 6, 9 and 14 by microscopy.
   Pollen grains were then transferred to slides using a portable forensic
   vacuum handle. Ten single grains per swatch were isolated for DNA
   analysis. DNA was extracted using a high throughput extraction method. A
   nine-locus short tandem repeat (STR) multiplex system, including
   previously published primers from Pinus taeda, was developed. DNA was
   amplified by PCR using fluorescent dyes and analyzed by capillary
   electrophoresis. Pollen counts from cotton swatches in a 14-day period
   exhibited an exponential decay from 100\% to 17\%. The success rate of
   PCR amplification was 81.2\%. Complete and partial STR profiles were
   generated from 250 pollen grains analyzed (44\% and 37\%, respectively).
   Due to the limited amount of DNA, drop-in events were observed (1.87\%).
   However, the rate of contamination with pollen from other pine
   individuals originating from environmental sources was 4.4\%. In
   conclusion, this study has shown that pollen can be a stable source of
   forensic DNA evidence, as a proof-of-principle, and that may persist on
   cotton clothing for at least 14 days of wear. This method can be applied
   in forensic cases where pollen grains larger than 10 mu m (e.g., from
   herbs or trees) may be transferred to clothing (worn by suspect or
   victim) by primary contact. (C) 2015 The Chartered Society of Forensic

Abstract = {{For decades Raman spectroscopy has been used as a specialized tool in a
   variety of fields. Forensic science is one discipline in particular that
   has greatly benefited from the application of Raman spectroscopic
   research. Here, studies using Raman spectroscopy for analyzing
   criminalistic evidence, including body fluids, human tissue, bones,
   gunshot residue, fibers, and hair, are reviewed. Many of these methods
   demonstrate the significance of incorporating chemometrics for data
   analysis to provide more reliable and quantitative results with
   associated errors. Currently, there are only a few branches of forensic
   science that use Raman spectroscopy in practice, despite its wide range
   of advantages. However, many more applications have been developed in
   the research setting and are presented here. These studies showcase the
   versatility and dependability of Raman spectroscopy, specifically for
   criminalistic purposes. The advantages of developing and transitioning
   these techniques to be used in practice are also discussed, including
   the tremendous benefits of portable instrumentation. Raman spectroscopy
   can easily become an established analytical technique for many
   criminalistics disciplines because it allows for obtaining real-time,
   rapid, impartial, statistically confident results. Consequently, the
   improvements to forensic science as a whole will be revolutionary.

Title = {{Soil transference patterns on bras: Image processing and laboratory
   dragging experiments}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{258}},
Pages = {{88-100}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In a recent Australian homicide, trace soil on the victim's clothing
   suggested she was initially attacked in her front yard and not the park
   where her body was buried. However the important issue that emerged
   during the trial was how soil was transferred to her clothing. This
   became the catalyst for designing a range of soil transference
   experiments (STEs) to study, recognise and classify soil patterns
   transferred onto fabric when a body is dragged across a soil surface.
   Soil deposits of interest in this murder were on the victim's bra and
   this paper reports the results of anthropogenic soil transfer to
   bra-cups and straps caused by dragging. Transfer patterns were recorded
   by digital photography and photomicroscopy.
   Eight soil transfer patterns on fabric, specific to dragging as the
   transfer method, appeared consistently throughout the STEs. The
   distinctive soil patterns were largely dependent on a wide range of soil
   features that were measured and identified for each soil tested using
   X-ray Diffraction and Non-Dispersive Infra-Red analysis.
   Digital photographs of soil transfer patterns on fabric were analysed
   using image processing software to provide a soil object-oriented
   classification of all soil objects with a diameter of 2 pixels and above
   transferred. Although soil transfer patterns were easily identifiable by
   naked-eye alone, image processing software provided objective numerical
   data to support this traditional (but subjective) interpretation.
   Image software soil colour analysis assigned a range of Munsell colours
   to identify and compare trace soil on fabric to other trace soil
   evidence from the same location; without requiring a spectrophotometer.
   Trace soil from the same location was identified by linking soils with
   similar dominant and subdominant Munsell colour peaks.
   Image processing numerical data on the quantity of soil transferred to
   fabric, enabled a relationship to be discovered between soil type, clay
   mineralogy (smectite), particle size and soil moisture content that
   would not have been possible otherwise. Soil type (e.g. Anthropogenic,
   gravelly sandy loam soil or Natural, organic-rich soil), clay mineralogy
   (smectite) and soil moisture content were the greatest influencing
   factors in all the dragging soil transference tests (both naked eye and
   measured properties) to explain the eight categories of soil
   transference patterns recorded.
   This study was intended to develop a method for dragging soil
   transference laboratory experiments and create a baseline of preliminary
   soil type/property knowledge. Results confirm the need to better
   understand soil behaviour and properties of clothing fabrics by further
   testing of a wider range of soil types and clay mineral properties. (C)

Abstract = {{In pharmaceutical and biomedical analyses, sample preparation is
   essential for the isolation and concentration of target compounds from
   complex biological matrices. This process is both labor-intensive and
   error-prone and markedly influences the reliability and accuracy of
   determining molecules of interest. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is
   a simple and convenient sample preparation technique that has enabled
   automation, miniaturization, high-throughput performance, and on-line
   coupling with analytical instruments. Moreover, SPME has reduced
   analysis times, as well as the cost of solvents and disposal. SPME
   procedures have been modified to address requirements of specific
   applications. More robust fiber assemblies and coatings with higher
   extraction efficiencies, selectivity and stability have been
   commercialized. Furthermore, devices have been designed to use capillary
   tubes, magnetic stir bars or thin films rather than fibers for
   extraction. This review focuses on novel SPME techniques, including
   fiber SPME, in-tube SPME and related techniques, reported in the past
   five years. Their applications to pharmaceutical, forensic and
   diagnostic studies and to determinations of environmental and
   occupational exposure are also summarized.}},

   more complete approximation focused on determining the specific color of
   the fibers providing adding Raman spectroscopy to the analytical scheme.
   Sometimes, it also provided information about the polymeric nature of
   the fibers. Regarding FTIR spectroscopy, it is the recommended tool to
   determine the fiber nature. Raman and FTIR spectroscopy are
   complementary techniques and a frequent recommendation is a combination
   of both techniques, in order to get a comprehensive analysis of textile
   fibers. On the other hand, new and more informative analytical
   techniques are emerging to the analysis of textile fibers as traces

Pages = {{494-499}},
Abstract = {{Background: Drug research and development has entered into the new epoch
   of innovation formulation, and the drug delivery system has been in the
   forefront of pharmaceutical innovation. Nanotechnology is widely used in
   fiber and textiles, electronics, space, agriculture, forensic science
   and medical therapeutics. It increasingly plays a significant role in
   drug delivery system. Compared with traditional delivery system, the
   nanoparticle drug delivery system has lots of merits, such as the high
   drug loading ability, the excellent biocompatibility, low toxicity,
   controlled and targeted drug release.
   Methods: We undertook a structured research of biodegradable polymeric
   nanoparticles used as delivery carrier for drug using a focused review
   question and inclusion/exclusion criteria. We have searched the
   bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature. The
   outstanding characteristics of the screened papers were described
   respectively, and a systematic content analysis methodology was used to
   analysis the findings.
   Results: Seventy-three papers were included in the review, the majority
   defined leadership and governance approaches that had impacted upon the
   polymeric nanoparticles as the delivery carrier for drug in therapeutic
   applications and developments. Seven papers outlined the superiority
   characteristics of polymeric nanoparticles that applied in the field of
   vaccine. Forty-seven papers overviewed the application prospects of
   polymeric nanoparticles used as drug delivery carrier for cancer. These
   included current advances in research and clinical applications of
   polymeric nanoparticles. The review identified the drug delivery carrier
   of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles, and we described the synthesis
   methods, applications and challenges of polymeric nanoparticles.
   Conclusion: The findings of this review identified that the
   biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles were used as delivery carrier for
   drug currently. It also indicates that the biodegradable polymeric
   nanoparticles play an important role in the drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, forensic soil examination was a routine aspect of forensic
   trace evidence examinations. However, the apparent need for soil
   examinations has diminished and with it the capability of forensic
   laboratories to carry out soil examination has been eroded. In recent
   years, due to soil examinations contributing to some high profile
   investigations, interest in soil examinations has been renewed. The need
   for, and suggested pathways to, the reinstatement of soil examinations
   as a trace evidence sub-discipline within forensic science laboratories
   is presented in this chapter. An examination procedure is also proposed
   that includes: appropriate sample collection and storage by qualified
   crime scene examiners; the preliminary examination of soils by trace
   evidence scientists within a forensic science laboratory; and the
   higher-level examination of soils by specialist geologists and
   palynologists. Soil examinations conducted by trace evidence scientists
   will be facilitated if the examinations are conducted using the
   instrumentation routinely used by these examiners. Trace evidence
   scientists routinely use a microspectrophotometer (MSP) for the colour
   analysis of forensic samples, including paint, fibres, inks and toners.
   This chapter also presents how a microspectrophotometer can be used to
   objectively measure the colour of forensic-sized soil samples as a
   demonstration as to how the proposed examination procedure can
   incorporate both trace evidence scientists within a forensic laboratory
   and specialist soil scientists.}},

Abstract = {{DNA profiling usually rests on source or sub-source level in the
   hierarchy of propositions and when used as evidence for level of
   activity and offence, much of its seemingly impenetrable power may be
   lost {[}1]. Fully Bayesian approach of evidence analysis for higher
   level propositions is achievable using Bayesian network. However,
   forensic geneticist alone does not have sufficient data and expertise to
   perform such analysis in real case scenario. Moreover, they would
   overstep the role of scientist in the judicial process.
   With a benefit of hindsight, it is possible to perform such kind of
   analysis for highly publicised cases. Such case is one of the former
   professional football star and actor O.J. Simpson who was tried on two
   counts of murder (of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and waiter
   Ronald Lyle Goldman).
   Here I present Bayesian network created on the basis of two other
   Bayesian nets {[}2,3] and information from Wikipedia. Five separate
   Bayesian nets (Motive; Occasion and Escape; Gloves; Knife; and
   Bloodstains, Hairs, and Fibres) are combined to yield the total
   likelihood ratio of over seven bans what would change 50\% prior to
   99.99999\% posterior probability of O.J. Simpson stabbing two persons to
   death. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of fibre traces via tape lifting, tape scanning and manual
   isolation is investigated. The recovery efficiency of taping was
   determined using different tapes, donor textiles, and receptor textiles.
   It was determined that tape lifts generally recover over 90\% of
   extraneous fibres that had been transferred by direct contact with a
   donor textile. The recovery via tape scanning was evaluated by the
   preparation of a set of 15 tapes that contained a number of target
   fibres on a background of other fibres. The tapes presented varying
   difficulty and were investigated by trained fibre examiners. The
   examiners were asked to locate the target fibres and to provide their
   opinion on the difficulty of the search. As expected, the efficiency
   decreases for more difficult searches. It was determined that the
   efficiency of the search was influenced by the microscopic illumination
   modes used by the examiner. A final experiment investigated the recovery
   by manual isolation of fibres from non-textile items. It was determined
   that all fibres from tie cables and knives were recovered, except in
   those cases where the recipient item contained many fibres. In addition,
   the examiners correctly sampled each of three fibre populations present
   on a sample of duct tape. (C) 2015 The Chartered Society of Forensic

Abstract = {{Reactively-dyed black, navy blue and medium red cotton samples showing
   metamerism under fluorescent tube illumination were examined. Optical
   microscopy (bright field, polarization and fluorescence microscopy) was
   used, followed by microspectrometry in the visible range (MSP Vis), to
   differentiate the samples in each block of colours. Additionally, the
   non-discriminated samples were subjected both to microspectrophotometry
   in the UV-range (MSP UV) and to enzymatic digestion followed by high
   performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) on the digests. While it
   was found that both methods may potentially result in higher
   discrimination, preparation of reactively-dyed cotton for HPTLC was
   found to be a very tedious and time-consuming step and HPTLC only led to
   a better discrimination than MSP UV for the red cotton samples. The
   results suggest that in order to increase the discrimination for
   reactively-dyed cotton fibres, measurement of the UV absorption spectrum
   (MSP UV) is preferred over HPTLC. (C) 2015 The Chartered Society of

Journal = {{SCIENCE \& JUSTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{431-436}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The persistence of fibre traces is a critical factor in the evaluation
   of fibre findings in forensic casework. Water can play a major role in
   affecting fibre persistence as a lot of fibre traces can get lost after
   washing incriminated garments, after rainfall over the victim's body or
   after immersion of the victim in water. The influence of immersion in
   standing water on fibre persistence was previously studied in our
   laboratory on various knitted recipient fabrics. The present study is
   focused on the persistence of target fibres on immersed cotton T-shirts
   through an immersion/stay/emersion process in running water (from 1 h up
   to 7 h), simulated in laboratory (similar to 0.4 l/s, gentle water flow
   conditions) and in real conditions (similar to 2000 l/s, medium water
   flow conditions). A gentle water flow slightly affects fibre
   persistence, which remains more or less constant over time, regardless
   of the duration of the stay in water. No rapid loss is observed during
   immersion in real conditions, including a medium water flow and boat
   activity. The fibre persistence in running water seems to depend mainly
   on the immersion step and also, in case of a medium water flow, on the
   stay in water with a linear loss over hours. (C) 2015 The Chartered

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{257}},
Pages = {{285-292}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nineteen black inkjet inks of six different brands were examined by
   fibre optics reflection spectroscopy in Visible and Near Infrared Region
   (Vis-NIR FORS) directly on paper with a view to achieving good
   resolution between them. These different inks were tested on nineteen
   different inkjet printers from three brands. Samples were obtained from
   prints by reflection probe. Processed reflection spectra in the range
   500-1000 nm were used as samples in principal component analysis.
   Variability between spectra of the same ink obtained from different
   prints, as well as between spectra of square areas and lines was
   examined. For both spectra obtained from square areas and lines
   reference, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) models were created.
   According to these models, the inkjet inks were divided into clusters.
   PCA method is able to separate inks containing carbon black as main
   colorant from the other inks using other colorants. Some spectra were
   recorded from another piece of printer and used as validation samples.
   Spectra of validation samples were projected onto reference PCA models.
   According to position of validation samples in score plots it can be
   concluded that PCA based on Vis-NIR FORS can reliably differentiate
   inkjet inks which are included in the reference database. The presented
   method appears to be a suitable tool for forensic examination of
   questioned documents containing inkjet inks. Inkjet inks spectra were
   obtained without extraction or cutting sample with possibility to
   measure out of the laboratory (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Discovering common origins of trace evidential textile fibers can be a
   challenging task when fiber structure or dye composition does not
   provide exclusive identifying information. Introduction of new chemical
   species after mass production and distribution of a textile may be
   exploited to trace its history and identify the origin of its fibers. In
   this article, fluorescence microscopy is used to examine the alteration
   in the fluorescence spectral fingerprint of single fibers resulting from
   exposure to commonly used detergents that contain fluorescent whitening
   agents. Dyed acrylic, cotton, and nylon fibers were laundered and the
   spectral contribution of the detergent on single fibers was quantified
   and shown to reach a maximum after five sequential washes; some
   detergents showed statistically meaningful differences to fiber spectra
   after only a single wash. Principal component cluster analysis was used
   to determine that the spectra of laundered fibers are distinct from the
   spectra of dyed, unwashed cotton or nylon, but not acrylic, fibers.}},

Abstract = {{To analyze, interpret and evaluate microscopic images, used in medical
   diagnostics and forensic science, video images for educational purposes
   were made with a very high resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels (4K), which
   is four times as many pixels as High-Definition Video (1920 x 1080
   pixels). The unprecedented high resolution makes it possible to see
   details that remain invisible to any other video format. The images of
   the specimens (blood cells, tissue sections, hair, fibre, etc.) are
   recorded using a 4K video camera which is attached to a light
   microscope. After processing, this resulted in very sharp and highly
   detailed images. This material was then used in education for classroom
   discussion. Spoken explanation by experts in the field of medical
   diagnostics and forensic science was also added to the high-resolution
   video images to make it suitable for self-study.
   Lay Description 4K video (4K UHD) offers lifelike video images. The
   unprecedented high resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels is at least four
   times sharper than High-Definition TV and makes it possible to see
   details that remain invisible to any other video format. In combination
   with perfect sound, this provides a unique viewing and listening
   experience that is almost like entering a new kind of reality. 4K video
   makes new applications possible, for instance, in cinema, education,
   telepresence, gaming, visualization, science and medical diagnostics and
   - research. In a project with 4K video applications in higher education,
   we investigated the possibilities of using this technique for examining
   microscopic slides used in medical laboratory diagnostics and forensic
   science. For example, examination of blood smears, hair and fibres. For
   this purpose, we attached a 4K digital video camera to a light
   microscope to make 4K images. The added value of using 4K video to look
   at these microscopic slides is mainly in the sharp and detailed image
   that 4K video provides after zooming, unlike traditional video
   recording. 4K video also offers the possibility to go from global to
   detail without loss of sharpness, which is very important in this type
   of application. The ability to evaluate these slides is very important
   and requires much practice for students. 4K video images can be used
   during a class discussion. After adding expert comments to the video
   images by the teacher, it can also be used by the students for
   self-study. The 4K video technique enables our students to analyze,
   interpret and evaluate the microscopic slides by using very
   high-resolution images, which were not available until now.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on the comparison of a standard extraction process

   FLOQswabs (TM). Swabs (n = 90) were either processed using the DNA IQ
   (TM) kit or, for direct PCR, swab fibers (similar to 2 mm(2)) were added
   directly to the PCR with no prior extraction. A significant increase in
   the height of the alleles (p < 0.005) was observed when using the direct
   PCR approach over the extraction methodology when controlling for

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a microstructured capillary electrophoresis
   method for the determination of minimal amounts of nitrocellulose in
   dynamite samples. A 6-hole microstructured capillary (MSC) was selected
   for the method development. First, the hydrodynamic behaviour of the MSC
   was studied at varying lengths (31,41 and 51 cm), which had never been
   studied before. Next, one of the MSC segments (31 cm) was employed to
   develop a microstructured capillary electrophoresis method to determine
   nitrocellulose in dynamite. In a first evaluation, the dynamite
   derivatization process was investigated to obtain an efficient
   derivatization yield. Afterward, the instrumental parameters, more
   specifically voltage and capillary cartridge temperature, were
   optimized. Afterward, the analytical performance of the developed
   methodology was assessed. Dynamite analyses during a period of 15 days
   were performed to establish intra-day (10 analyses) and inter-day (40
   analyses) precision, obtaining RSDs lower than 6\% and 10\%,
   respectively. Besides, RSDs for migration time (<0.5\%), peak asymmetry
   (<3\%), resolution (<3.9\%), and S/N (<9\%) were obtained. Finally, a
   diluted sample of dynamite was analyzed, detecting amounts of
   nitrocellulose in the order of 220-400 pg. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Improved radiocarbon analyses of modern human hair to determine the

Abstract = {{RationaleIn forensic investigation, radiocarbon (C-14) measurements of
   human tissues (i.e., nails and hair) can help determine the
   year-of-death. However, the frequent use of cosmetics can bias hair C-14
   results as well as stable isotope values. Evidence shows that hair
   exogenous impurities percolate beyond the cuticle layer, and therefore
   conventional pretreatments are ineffective in removing them.
   MethodsWe conducted isotopic analysis (C-14, C-13, N-15 and C/N) of
   conventionally treated and cross-flow nanofiltered amino acid
   (CFNAA)-treated samples (scalp- and body-hair) from a single female
   subject using fingernails as a reference. The subject studied frequently
   applies a permanent dark-brown dye kit to her scalp-hair and uses other
   care products for daily cleansing. We also performed pyrolysis-gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analyses of CFNAA-treated
   scalp-hair to identify contaminant remnants that could possibly
   interfere with isotopic analyses.
   ResultsThe conventionally treated scalp- and body-hair showed C-14
   offsets of similar to 21 and similar to 9 parts per thousand,
   respectively. These offsets confirm the contamination by petrochemicals
   in modern human hair. A single CFNAA extraction reduced those offsets by
   similar to 34\%. No significant improvement was observed when sequential
   extractions were performed, as it appears that the procedure introduced
   some foreign contaminants. A chromatogram of the CFNAA scalp-hair
   pyrolysis products showed the presence of petroleum and plant/animal
   compound residues, which can bias isotopic analyses.
   ConclusionsWe have demonstrated that CFNAA extractions can partially
   remove cosmetic contaminants embedded in human hair. We conclude that
   fingernails are still the best source of keratin protein for
   year-of-death determinations and isotopic analysis, with body-hair
   and/or scalp-hair coupled with CFNAA extraction a close second.

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{In the forensic assessment of burned bodies, the question of whether the
   victim was exposed to fire before or after death is of crucial
   importance. Many authors consider tongue protrusion in cases of burned
   bodies to be a post-mortem phenomenon. Deep-heating effects of fire are
   sufficient to cook muscle. The muscle becomes shortened by dehydration
   and protein denaturation. Exposure to heat causes flexion of the
   extremities on the contraction of muscles and tendons - heat rigour. The
   flexors, being bulkier than the extensors, contract more and force the
   limbs into the position of general flexion. The genioglossus is the
   major muscle of the tongue and is responsible for protruding or sticking
   out the tongue: by means of its inferior fibres, it draws the root of
   the tongue forward and protrudes the apex from the mouth. Similar to the
   action of limb flexors exposed to heat and the appearance of post-mortem
   general flexion of a burned body due to heat rigour, perhaps the
   geniglossus could be shortened by heat, causing post-mortem tongue
   protrusion to appear as heat rigour of the tongue. In this paper, we
   present two such cases of protrusion of the tongue in bodies burned
   after death - cases of arson to cover homicide.}},

Title = {{Utilization of environmentally acquired very small particles as a means
   of association}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{254}},
Pages = {{26-50}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Very small particles (VSP) are ubiquitous in our environment and are
   virtually ignored by forensic science. These particles range in size
   from an order of magnitude smaller than conventional trace evidence,
   down to the molecular level. Combinations of VSP provide an
   extraordinary, largely untapped resource for forensic associations and
   source attribution. This paper describes an initial effort to exploit
   VSP for one specific application.
   An approach was developed and tested for the SEM/EDS analysis of VSP
   recovered from the surfaces of carpet fibers -one of the most common
   types of trace evidence examined in crime laboratories. Our goal was to
   exploit existing computer-assisted SEM/EDS methods to test whether VSP
   profiles could be useful to associate shed fibers with a source carpet.
   Particles were harvested by washing and filtration onto polycarbonate
   filters. An SEM/EDS analysis protocol currently employed for
   environmental particle analyses was used, resulting in individual
   particle characterization based on fitting to reference spectra of 28
   elements. Target Particle Types were defined based on the most abundant
   elemental profiles and used to bin the results for each specimen,
   resulting in a Target Particle Type profile.
   Within-carpet variability was assessed using Target Particle Type
   profiles from three different areas on each of nine carpets. Area
   profiles, defined from sets of ten fibers, were compared to profiles
   from individual fibers. Between-item variation was explored using a
   survey of an additional 12 carpets.
   Hundreds to thousands of VSP were found to routinely occur on individual
   carpet fibers. Their quantity and character was sufficient to associate
   fibers with their area of origin. Within-carpet variations showed
   roughly even distributions for most TPTs and between-carpet variations
   showed wide ranges in types and quantities of VSP.
   Environmentally acquired VSP showed clear potential to provide
   quantitative means to link carpet fibers with their area of origin. This
   finding is noteworthy, since such particles are acquired postmanufacture
   and are independent of characteristics determined by manufacture. More
   generally, VSP are ubiquitous, present on or in virtually any item, and
   there is the potential for linkages among items of any type based on
   adhering VSP. By way of example, the present work provides impetus for a
   fundamental change in the way that forensic trace evidence is
   conceptualized. Further fundamental research is indicated to better
   understand the underlying variability, usefulness and limitations of
   this approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose In traumatic brain injury, diffusion-weighted and diffusion
   tensor imaging of the brain are essential techniques for determining the
   pathology sustained and the outcome. Postmortem cross-sectional imaging
   is an established adjunct to forensic autopsy in death investigation.
   The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate postmortem
   diffusion tensor imaging in forensics for its feasibility, influencing
   factors and correlation to the cause of death compared with autopsy.
   Methods Postmortem computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and
   diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking were performed in 10
   deceased subjects. The Likert scale grading of colored fractional
   anisotropy maps was correlated to the body temperature and intracranial
   pathology to assess the diagnostic feasibility of postmortem diffusion
   tensor imaging and fiber tracking.
   Results Optimal fiber tracking (>15,000 fiber tracts) was achieved with
   a body temperature at 10 degrees C. Likert scale grading showed no
   linear correlation (P > 0.7) to fiber tract counts. No statistically
   significant correlation between total fiber count and postmortem
   interval could be observed (P = 0.122). Postmortem diffusion tensor
   imaging and fiber tracking allowed for radiological diagnosis in cases
   with shearing injuries but was impaired in cases with pneumencephalon
   and intracerebral mass hemorrhage.
   Conclusions Postmortem diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking
   provides an exceptional in situ insight deep into the fibers of the
   brain with diagnostic benefit in traumatic brain injury and axonal
   injuries in the assessment of the underlying cause of death, considering
   influencing factors for optimal imaging technique.}},

Abstract = {{Gunshot residues, produced after shooting activity, have acquired their
   importance in analysis due to the notoriety of firearms-related crimes.
   In this study, solid-phase microextraction was performed to extract the
   headspace composition of spent cartridges using 85-mu m polyacrylate
   fiber at 66 degrees C for 21 min. Organic compounds, that is,
   naphthalene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, diphenylamine, and
   dibutyl phthalate were detected and analyzed by gas chromatography-flame
   ionization detection technique. Evaluation of chromatograms for
   diphenylamine, dibutyl phthalate, and naphthalene indicates the period
   after a gunshot was discharged, whether it was 1 days, 2-4 days, < 5
   days, 10 days, 20 days, or more than 30 days ago. This study revealed
   the potential effects of environmental factors such as occasional wind
   blow and direct sunlight on the estimation of time after spent
   cartridges were discharged. In conclusion, we proposed reliable
   alternative in analyzing the headspace composition of spent cartridges
   in a simulated crime scene.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1980s, cremation has become the fastest growing area of the
   U.S. funeral industry. At the same time, the number of litigations
   against funeral homes and cremation facilities has increased. Forensic
   anthropologists are often asked to determine whether the contents of an
   urn are actually cremated bone, and to address questions regarding the
   identity of the remains. This study uses both metric and chemical
   analyses for resolving a case of contested cremains. A cremains weight
   of 2021.8 g was predicted based on the decedent's reported stature and
   weight. However, the urn contents weighed 4173.5 g. The urn contents
   also contained material inconsistent with cremains (e.g., moist
   sediment, stones, ferrous metal). Analysis using XRD and SEM
   demonstrated that the urn contained thermally altered bone as well as
   inorganic material consistent with glass fiber cement. Although
   forensically challenging, cremains cases such as this one can be
   resolved using a multidisciplinary approach.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of fibre traces is a critical factor in the evaluation
   of fibre findings in forensic casework. Many persistence studies have
   examined the loss of fibre traces on living subjects or on bodies
   exposed to open-air conditions but none of them have ever considered
   bodies in underwater conditions. This first part of a larger study
   focuses on the persistence of transferred fibres on various recipient
   garments during an immersion/emersion process as the common step to all
   casework involving underwater conditions. A smooth polyester garment
   leads to weak persistence values around 20\%, while higher persistence
   values, ranging between 80\% and 90\%, are obtained for more structured
   and textured garments (cotton T-shirts, fleece and acrylic pullovers).
   More textured garments are thus less affected by the immersion/emersion
   process and fibre findings are closer to their initial amount and
   distribution before immersion. The amount of protruding fibres and the
   density of the rough fibrous network at the surface of the recipient
   garment are both key factors that increase the persistence value.
   Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when evaluating
   fibre evidence recovered on immersed bodies. (C) 2015 The Chartered

Journal = {{MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN}},

Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-46}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence of extensive pollution of the environment by
   microplastic, with microfibres representing a large proportion of the
   microplastics seen in marine sediments. Since microfibres are ubiquitous
   in the environment, present in the laboratory air and water, evaluating
   microplastic pollution is difficult. Incidental contamination is highly
   likely unless strict control measures are employed. Here we describe
   methods developed to minimize the amount of incidental post-sampling
   contamination when quantifying marine microfibre pollution. We show that
   our protocol, adapted from the field of forensic fibre examination,
   reduces fibre abundance by 90\% and enables the quick screening of fibre
   populations. These methods therefore allow an accurate estimate of
   microplastics polluting marine sediments. In a case study from a series
   of samples collected on a research vessel, we use these methods to
   highlight the prevalence of microfibres as marine microplastics. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Numerous polypropylene hollow fiber microfiltration membrane modules
   were severely degraded after utilization as pretreatment in a military
   water purification system. To determine the plausible causes of
   degradation, thermal, chemical, and mechanical material properties were
   initially evaluated by using differential scanning calorimetry,
   thermogravimetric analysis, C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance,
   attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy, and a tensile
   strength material testing system. The evaluation implied oxidation
   during the usage or storage of the samples. Protocols using more
   specialized techniques, micro-Raman spectroscopy along with energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and an atomic force microscope-based
   nano-thermal analysis, were developed to examine the chemical and
   thermal properties along the cross-section of the samples at the micron
   and submicron-scale. These results indicated that the degradation mainly
   took place at the outer and inner boundaries of the samples. Pristine
   samples exposed to several plausibly harsh environments did not evidence
   the same level of mechanical failure, but a few circumstances had
   similar test responses, leading to a hypothesis of high oxidative stress
   as the main failure etiology versus a slowly evolving one. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{A hyperspectral imaging instrument analyzing fibers between crossed
   polarizers spectrometrically is presented. The principle of operation is
   introduced and illustrated briefly by the theory of polarization and
   birefingence and calculations based on Stokes parameters and Muller
   matrices. Afterward, the developed instrumentation and results are
   detailed. Results obtained by the calculations and developed
   instrumentation indicate that the retardance of birefringent materials
   can be calculated over a high range and with a high accuracy. In
   addition, the spatial resolution of the instrument suffices to analyze
   different regions within a fiber individually. This allows the selection
   of a region at the center of an analyzed fiber that is shown to provide
   an optimal signal. The developed software enables analysis of the
   polarization color and the ``normal{''}, i.e., absorptive color of the
   sample individually. These features make possible a preliminary
   identification of fibers, without isolation of the fiber from a
   microscope slide. The instrument forms a powerful new approach to
   automated analyses in forensic fiber evidence, as it can establish
   analyses of morphology, color, and identity of a set of samples in a
   high-throughput, automated, and objective way.}},

Abstract = {{The historical development, contributions and limitations of the two
   traditional approaches to trace evidence analysis are reviewed. The
   first approach was as generalist practitioner, looking broadly at an
   assemblage of many different particle types. The second was that of
   specialist practitioner, with attention focused on one specific particle
   type. Four factors have significantly impacted the effectiveness of
   these approaches: (1) increasing technological capabilities, (2)
   increasing complexity in the character of manufactured materials, (3)
   changes in forensic laboratory management, and (4) changing scientific
   and legal expectations. The effectiveness of each approach is assessed
   within the context of these changes. More recently, new technologies
   have been applied to some trace evidence problems, intended to address
   one or more limitations. This has led to a third approach founded on
   discrete, highly technical methods addressing specific analytical
   problems. After evaluating the contributions and limitations of this
   third approach, we consider the different ways that technologies could
   be developed to address unmet needs in forensic trace evidence analysis.
   The route toward effective use of new technologies is contrasted with
   how forensic science laboratories are currently choosing and employing
   them. The conclusion is that although new technologies are contributing,
   we are not on a path that will result in their most effective and
   appropriate use. A new approach is required.
   Based on an analysis of the contributions of each of the three exisiting
   approaches, seven characteristics of an effective trace evidence
   analysis capability were determined: (1) particle traces should be a
   major problem-solving tool, (2) there should be readily available,
   straightforward methods to enable their use, (3) all available and
   potentially useful particle types should be considered, (4) decisions to
   use them should be made in the context of each case, guided by what they
   can contribute to the case and how efficiently they can do so, (5)
   analyses should be conducted using appropriate technologies, (6)
   findings should be timely and directly integrated with case-specific
   problems, and (7) new technologies should be used to improve the overall
   effectiveness of the capability.
   Clearly new technologies have the potential to revolutionize forensic
   trace evidence, but just as clearly some of the traditional capabilities
   have been rendered ineffective, or lost entirely, by the way we have
   come to approach the problem. Having critically defined the current
   limitations of and the desired outcomes, the next focus should be
   consideration of alternative approaches that might achieve such a
   result. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main purposes of this study was to assess the usefulness of
   microspectrophotometry (MSP), both in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible
   (Vis) range for discriminating single cotton fibres dyed with reactive
   dyes coming from the same manufacturer, as well as the possibility of
   evaluation of the concentration of dye in an examine fibre. This study
   utilised woven cotton fabrics dyed with different concentrations of
   onecompound reactive dyes with the commercial name Cibacron (R) (at
   present Novacron (R)) as the focus of the MSP analysis.
   The spectra were recorded in the UV-Vis range between 200 and 800 nm, in
   transmission mode. The results from this study illustrated that all of
   the analysed cotton samples dyed with reactive dyes were distinguishable
   between each other with the use of MSP, mostly in the visible, and also
   in ultraviolet range. The limit for applied MSP techniques was 0.18\% of
   the concentration of a dye in the textile sample. The results indicate
   that based on the absorbance measurements for fibres constituting e.g.
   forensic traces it was not possible to estimate the concentration of the
   dye in the fibre because Beer's law did not obey. The intra-sample, and
   inter- sample variation, as well as dichroism effect in a case of a
   cotton fibres dyed with reactive dye were observed. On the basis of the
   results obtained for each analysed cotton sample, it was concluded that
   there was no correlation between colour uniformity in cotton fabric
   (changes in lightness, red/green and yellow/blue colour) and
   concentration of the reactive dye. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the second part of this survey, the ability of micro-Raman

   that the Raman technique plays a complementary and useful role to obtain
   further discriminations after the application of light microscopy
   methods and UV-vis microspectrophotometry and assure the nondestructive
   nature of the analytical sequence. These additional discriminations were
   observed despite the lower discriminating powers of Raman data
   considered individually, compared to those of light microscopy and
   UV-vis MSP. This study also confirms that an instrument equipped with
   several laser lines is necessary for an efficient use as applied to the

   examinations}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{250}},
Pages = {{57-67}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to provide the first steps towards a numerical source
   level evaluation of fibre evidence. For that purpose, likelihood ratio
   equations are derived for four generic scenarios, in which the source
   frequency, the number of references and trace types investigated, and
   the number of matches vary. Previous experimental studies into the
   evaluation of fibre evidence are reviewed and we demonstrate how the
   results of these studies, as well as other data, can be used to evaluate
   the derived equations for the four scenarios. Evaluation is not
   straightforward and requires a number of assumptions. This is mainly
   because the relevant population under consideration in a specific case
   cannot be sufficiently evaluated. In addition, the subjective
   match-criterion in current forensic fibre examinations makes it
   impossible to implement a good evaluation of the within-variation of
   samples. As a result, the discrimination power, currently calculated for
   discrimination studies, is only valid for samples with negligible
   heterogeneity. We conclude that reporting a numerical evidential value
   for forensic fibre examinations is not yet feasible as the data are
   available for only a few types of fibres and cannot be used without
   several assumptions. We propose a number of developments that are
   required to improve the accuracy and numerical analysis. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Bloodstain pattern analysis is the investigation of blood deposited at
   crime scenes and the interpretation of that pattern. The surface that
   the blood gets deposited onto could distort the appearance of the
   bloodstain. The interaction of blood and apparel fabrics is in its
   infancy, but the interaction of liquids and apparel fabrics has been
   well documented and investigated in the field of textile science (e.g.
   the processes of wetting and wicking of fluids on fibres, yarns and
   fabrics). A systematic study on the final appearance of drip stains on
   torso apparel fabrics (100\% cotton plain woven, 100\% polyester plain
   woven, blend of polyester and cotton plain woven and 100\% cotton single
   jersey knit) that had been laundered for six, 26 and 52 cycles prior to
   testing was investigated in the paper. The relationship between drop
   velocity (1.66 +/- 0.50 m/s, 4.07 +/- 0.03 m/s, 5.34 +/- 0.18 m/s) and
   the stain characteristics (parent stain area, axes 1 and 2 and number of
   satellite stains) for each fabric was examined using analysis of
   variance. The experimental design and effect of storing blood were
   investigated on a reference sample, which indicated that the day (up to
   five days) at which the drops were generated did not affect the
   bloodstain. The effect of prior-laundering (six, 26 and 52 laundering
   cycles), fibre content (cotton vs. polyester vs. blend) and fabric
   structure (plain woven vs. single jersey knit) on the final appearance
   of the bloodstain were investigated. Distortion in the bloodstains
   produced on non-laundered fabrics indicated the importance of laundering
   fabrics to remove finishing treatments before conducting bloodstain
   experiments. For laundered fabrics, both the cotton fabrics and the
   blend had a circular to oval stain appearance, while the polyester
   fabric had a circular appearance with evidence of spread along the warp
   and weft yarns, which resulted in square-like stains at the lowest drop
   velocity. A significant (p < 0.001) increase in the stain size on
   laundered blend fabric was identified. Bloodstain characteristics varied
   due to fibre content (p < 0.001) and fabric structure (p < 0.001). Blood
   on polyester fabric, after impact, primarily moved due to capillary
   force and wicking of the blood along the fibres/yarns, while for the
   cotton fabrics wicking was accompanied by movement of blood into the
   fibres/yarns. This study highlights the importance for forensic analysts
   of apparel evidence to consider the age, the fibre type and the fabric
   structure before interpreting bloodstain patterns. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   were evaluated. The in-vial standard loading approach was found to be
   the most suitable method for both the standard curve preparation and
   sample analysis. Method specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy,
   recovery, method detection limit and the limit of quantitation were
   investigated for its intended purpose through the examination of common
   stabilisers and additives in smokeless powders, namely naphthalene,
   2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, diphenylamine,
   N,N-diphenylformamide, methyl centralite and ethyl centralite by the gas

Title = {{Lethal wood pellets. Carbon monoxide poisoning due to inappropriate

Journal = {{RECHTSMEDIZIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning either accidental or as suicide, is a
   common cause of death encountered in routine medicolegal autopsies. It
   is less well known that CO can also be formed from the resin in wood
   fibers. Wood pellets emit the highest amount of CO in the weeks
   following production. Insufficient ventilation, particularly during
   storage of freshly made wood pellets in storage bunkers for heating
   devices, therefore leads to accumulation of dangerous concentrations of
   CO.
   This article aims to alert the readership to the dangers of CO poisoning
   resulting from inappropriate storage of wood pellets.
   The dangers are exemplified by the case of a 43-year-old man who was
   found dead in a storage room for wood pellets. The cause of death was CO
   poisoning due to a blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration of 75 \%. The
   findings were compared with 14 further fatal cases of asphyxia involving
   wood pellets and wood products published in the literature for the time
   period 2002-2014. The first scientific investigations on this phenomenon
   were carried out particularly in the USA, Canada, Sweden and China as
   large-scale producers of wood pellets and were included in the
   assessment of the literature.
   The evaluation of the currently available literature showed that the
   dangers associated with the storage of wood pellets as a purportedly
   harmless source of energy are to a large extent unappreciated and have
   already led to fatal accidents. Under this aspect it is conspicuous that
   due to the expansion of the market into private dwellings, private users
   have also suffered fatal accidents so that an official risk assessment
   with a clear and uniform identification of hazards appears to be
   necessary.
   The public awareness of the dangers resulting from the storage of wood
   pellets must be increased. Official, uniform danger markings and
   recommendations for handling (e.g. only entering a pellet bunker with a
   CO detection warning device and/or breathing mask) should be made public
   in order to avoid fatal accidents by CO poisoning.}},

   group and its coworkers over the past 15years is presented. The work is
   focused on three areas: (1) substrate structure; (2) dye interactions in
   aqueous solution and on substrates; (3) dye degradation and products.
   For substrates, a detailed model of the nanoenvironment experienced by
   chemicals within cellulose fibre is given, showing the different
   environments and remarkable mobility of absorbed chemicals. Advanced
   nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion measurements provide the complex
   pathways by which compounds find their way in and out of the fibre. For
   dye interaction, detailed theoretical and experimental studies are
   reported on three model dye systems, the anionic monoazo dye Orange II,
   the bisazo anionic dye CI Direct Blue 1, and cationic monoazo thiazolium
   dyes, providing a comprehensive picture of their structure. A
   quantitative mechanism of dye binding to cellulose is shown. Resonance
   Raman provides an effective forensic tool for dye identification, even
   from single fibres. The products and kinetics of Orange II dye
   degradation by one-electron reduction in aqueous solution is given, with
   the identification of an indophenol dye end-product. In cellulosic
   materials the reduction mechanism is similar to solution, when the
   higher microviscosity is accounted for. Hydrolysis of thiazolium dyes
   occurs at both aromatic rings of the dye but on different timescales.
   Measurement and calculations of the electronic structures of
   one-electron-reduced and -oxidised dyes are presented. The mechanism of
   photooxidation by sunlight of azo dyes in cotton is delineated.}},

Abstract = {{Hair is one of the most common types of physical evidence found at a
   crime scene. Forensic examination may suggest a connection between a
   suspect and a crime scene or victim, or it may demonstrate an absence of
   such associations. Therefore, forensic analysis of hair evidence is
   invaluable to criminal investigations. Current hair forensic
   examinations are primarily based on a subjective microscopic comparison
   of hair found at the crime scene with a sample of suspects hair. Since
   this is often inconclusive, the development of alternative and
   more-accurate hair analysis techniques is critical. In this study, we
   utilized surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to demonstrate that
   artificial dyes can be directly detected on hair. This spectroscopic
   technique is capable of a confirmatory identification of analytes with
   single molecule resolution, requires minimal sample, and has the
   advantage of fluorescence quenching. Our study reveals that SERS can (1)
   identify whether hair was artificially dyed or not, (2) determine if a
   permanent or semipermanent colorants were used, and (3) distinguish the
   commercial brands that are utilized to dye hair. Such analysis is rapid,
   minimally destructive, and can be performed directly at the crime scene.
   This study provides a novel perspective of forensic investigations of
   hair evidence.}},

Abstract = {{A target fibre study was carried out to assess the random prevalence of
   two ostensibly commonly encountered synthetic fibre types; black acrylic
   and blue polyester. The study was performed in an environment which
   maximised the number of random contacts between textile garments in the
   population and specific surfaces, namely; seating relating to buses,
   public houses and cinemas found within a large urban conurbation.
   Surface debris tapings were collected from samples of bus seats (30),
   pub seats (54) and cinema seats (53). Using low power stereomicroscopy,
   a total of 114 and 68 fibres, superficially similar to the respective
   black acrylic and blue polyester target fibres, were recovered from
   these tapings. The full range of comparative microscopical and
   instrumental analysis used in operational forensic laboratories was
   performed on the recovered fibres. No matches were found with either of
   the target fibres. These findings are in accordance with similar studies
   which show that the probability of an `adventitious' match with a
   particular fibre type/colour combination is extremely low. In addition,
   the findings demonstrate that the current techniques and instrumentation
   employed by operational forensic laboratories are fit for purpose.
   Importantly, the findings demonstrate that databases and surveys (e.g.
   fibre population studies) which do not consider the
   analytical/comparison processes, must not be used in isolation when
   evaluating fibre evidence at source level. (C)) 2015 Forensic Science

Abstract = {{Two prototypes of microstructured capillaries (MSCs) were designed,
   manufactured, and used to carry out different experiments. MSC-1
   consisted of six holes of approximate to 28m id whereas MSC-2 consisted
   of 85 holes of approximate to 7.7m id. A fundamental study on the
   hydrodynamic injection through a commercial CE equipment was conducted.
   Experimental times to flush specific volumes were approximately three
   times larger than the theoretical values. Then, the detection of starch
   was carried out by using the MSCs and conventional capillaries, and the
   electropherograms were compared on the basis of analytical parameters
   employed in CE. An improvement in peak asymmetry was obtained for the
   MSC-1 compared to the conventional capillaries. S/N was one order of
   magnitude increased with the MSC, improving ten times the sensitivity.
   Considering this advantage, the separation and detection of nitrostarch
   was performed as a first application of the MSC-1. Minimal sample
   amounts of nitrostarch (1.7g) were detected. Results present a real
   interest in forensics since this substance had not been previously
   detected through CE, leading to new investigations in the design of new
   capillaries capable of enhancing CE performance.}},

Abstract = {{A new design of hollow fiber solid-liquid phase micro extraction
   (HF-SLPME) was developed for the determination of benzodiazepines (BZPs)
   in hair, urine and wastewater. The membrane extraction with
   1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide coated titanium dioxide
   ({[}PMIM]Br@TiO2) sorbent used in this research is a two-phase supported
   membrane extraction consisting of an aqueous (donor phase), and
   n-octanol/nano {[}PMIM]Br@TiO2 (acceptor phase) system operated in
   direct immersion sampling mode. The 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide
   (ionic liquid) coated nano TiO2 dispersed in the organic solvent
   (n-octanol) is held into a porous membrane supported by capillary forces
   and sonification. It is in contact with the feed phase, which is the
   aqueous sample. The experimental setup is very simple and highly
   affordable. The hollow fiber is disposable, so single use of the fiber
   reduces the risk of cross-contamination and carry-over problems. The
   proposed method allows the very effective and enriched recuperation of
   BZPs into one single extract. In order to obtain high extraction
   efficiency of the analytes using this novel sorbent, the main parameters
   were optimized. Under the optimized extraction conditions, the method
   showed good linearity (0.05-6000 ng mL(-1)), low limits of detection
   (0.08-0.5 ng mL(-1)) and good enrichment (533-1190). (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Presented in this paper is an assessment of the applicability of Raman
   spectroscopy and microspectrophotometry (MSP) in visible and ultraviolet
   light (UV-Vis) in the examination of textile fibers dyed with mixtures
   of synthetic dyes. Fragments of single polyester fibers, stained with
   ternary mixtures of disperse dyes in small mass concentrations, and
   fragments of single cotton fibers, dyed with binary or ternary mixtures
   of reactive dyes, were subjected to the study. Three types of excitation
   sources, 514, 633, and 785 nm, were used during Raman examinations,
   while the MSP study was conducted in the 200 to 800 nm range. The
   results indicate that the capabilities for discernment of dye mixtures
   are similar in the spectroscopic methods that were employed. Both
   methods have a limited capacity to distinguish slightly dyed polyester
   fiber; additionally, it was found that Raman spectroscopy enables
   identification of primarily the major components in dye mixtures. The
   best results, in terms of the quality of Raman spectra, were obtained
   using an excitation source from the near infrared. MSP studies led to
   the conclusion that polyester testing should be carried out in the range
   above 310 nm, while for cotton fibers there is no limitation or
   restriction of the applied range. Also, MSP UV-Vis showed limited
   possibilities for discriminatory analysis of cotton fibers dyed with a
   mixture of reactive dyes, where the ratio of the concentration of the
   main dye used in the dyeing process to minor dye was higher than four.
   The results presented have practical applications in forensic studies,

Abstract = {{In this study, it is shown a method for the determination of
   benzodiazepines and their main metabolites in urine samples by
   hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) in the three-phase

   sodium acetate 2.0 mol/L buffer solution (pH 4.5), 25 mu L of
   beta-glucuronidase enzyme and incubation for 90 min at 55 degrees C. In
   parallel with hydrolysis, the LPME fiber (9 cm) was prepared. Its pores
   were filled with a mixture of dihexyl ether: 1-nonanol (9:1).
   Afterwards, a solution of 3.0 mol/L of HCl was introduced into the lumen
   of the fiber (acceptor phase). After hydrolysis, the fiber was submersed
   in the alkalinized urine (pH 10) containing 10\% NaCl. Samples were then
   submitted to orbital shaking (2400 rpm) for 90 min. The acceptor phase
   was later withdrawn from the fiber, dried and the residue derivatized
   with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) for 10 min at 60 degrees C with
   further addition of N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide
   containing 1\% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (MTBSTFA) for 45 min at 90
   degrees C followed by determination by gas chromatography mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS). The calibration curves obtained showed linearity
   over the specified range, with a similar sensitivity to traditional
   techniques and a higher detection capability compared to most of the
   miniaturized methods described in the literature. The method has been
   developed and successfully validated and applied to urine samples from
   real cases of benzodiazepines intake. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Thickness swell (TS) occurs when wood materials absorb moisture and as a
   consequence create pressure. This study examines the pressure generated
   following moisture absorption among eight common wood materials using
   modified methods from ASTM Standard E831 \& D1037 to measure the normal
   swelling pressures as moisture content changed (psi {[}MPa]). Most test
   samples expressed maximum pressure after 48 hours. The results showed
   average maximum pressures were achieved by the medium density fiber
   board (MDF) (144 psi {[}0.992 MPa]) while the lowest was gypsum board (5
   psi {[}0.034 MPa]). Comparison of the average maximum values revealed
   the highest pressures were derived from composite wood products (78 -
   144 psi {[}0.538-0.992 MPa], MDF, particle board and oriented strand
   board) when compared to laminate and solid wood products (57-65 psi
   {[}0.393-0.448 MPa], interior and exterior plywood and pressure treated
   pine). The results can support forensic investigations and the
   interpretation of building component failures.}},

Abstract = {{We report the case of a 92-year-old Japanese woman who suddenly died of
   rupture of the ascending aorta following hemopericardium due to
   idiopathic aortitis. Rupture of the ascending aorta is usually caused by
   trauma, an aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, infection, or a neoplasm,
   but no such etiologies were found in this case. The pathogenesis of the
   rupture of the aorta in the present case might have involved the
   destruction of elastic and collagen fiber due to lymphoplasmacytic
   infiltration through idiopathic aortitis and increased vulnerability of
   aortic wall following rupture. Aortitis is usually the cause of aortic
   aneurysm or dissection, however, aortic perforation is very rare. The
   frequency of sudden death due to this condition might be much higher
   than has been reported because cases in which no autopsy was performed
   would have been classified as unknown acute cardiac death. In cases
   involving sudden death, we have to keep in mind that the aorta can
   rupture in the absence of trauma or other typical etiologies.}},

Title = {{Mapping explosive residues on galvanized pipe bomb fragments using total
   vaporization solid phase microextraction (TV-SPME)}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{9756-9762}},
Abstract = {{Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is a popular sampling technique
   whereby analytes are sorbed to a coated fiber and subsequently desorbed
   into an analytical instrument. In headspace SPME, analytes partition
   between the sample, the headspace above the sample, and the SPME fiber
   coating. In total vaporization SPME (TV-SPME), sample extracts are
   heated until both the solvent and analytes completely vaporize,
   whereupon the analytes partition between the vapor phase and the SPME
   fiber. In this study, TV-SPME using a polyethylene glycol fiber was
   coupled with fast gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify
   components of double-base smokeless powder (DBSP). Nitroglycerin (NG),
   diphenylamine (DPA) and ethyl centralite (EC) were separated in under 5
   min. For NG, the optimal sample volume (70 mu L), extraction temperature
   (60 degrees C) and extraction time (20 min) resulted in a method that
   was over twelve fold more sensitive than traditional liquid injection
   and with a detection limit below 1 ppb. This method was then used to
   quantify DBSP residue on post-blast debris from five galvanized steel
   pipe bombs. The mean concentration of NG on the fragments was 0.25 ppm
   (w/w). An average of 1.01 mg of NG was recovered from the devices.
   Finally, the distribution of NG could be ``mapped{''} by tracking the
   original locations of each fragment within the device. These maps showed
   that the distribution of NG was far from uniform. In fact, the
   concentration of the NG on fragments originating from the end caps was
   several fold higher than in other locations. This finding can help guide
   the selection of bomb fragments for chemical analyses in real-world
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is one of the most destructive powers to which a building structure
   can be subjected, often exposing concrete elements to elevated
   temperatures. The relative properties of concrete after such an exposure
   are of significant importance in terms of the serviceability of
   buildings. Unraveling the heating history of concrete and different
   cooling regimes is important for forensic research or to determine
   whether a fire-exposed concrete structure and its components are still
   structurally sound or not. Assessment of fire-damaged concrete
   structures usually starts with visual observation of colour change,
   cracking and spalling. Thus, it is important to know the effect of
   elevated temperatures on normal strength retention properties of
   concrete. This study reports the effect of elevated temperature on the
   mechanical properties of the 100mm concrete cube specimen with
   polypropylene fibres and cooled differently under various regimes. In
   the heating cycle, the specimen were subjected to elevated temperatures
   ranging from 200(0)C to 800(0)C, in steps of 200(0)C with a rest period
   of 1 hour at the reference thermal levels.. Then they were cooled to
   room temperature differently. The cooling regimes studied include,
   furnace cooling, air cooling and sudden cooling. After exposure to
   elevated temperatures and cooled differently, the weight loss, and
   residual compressive strength retention characteristics were studied.
   Test results indicated that weight and compressive strengths
   significantly reduce, with an increase in temperature and are strongly
   dependent on cooling regimes adopted.}},

Abstract = {{Bioarcheology is cross disciplinary research encompassing the study of
   human remains. However, life's activities have, up till now, eluded
   bioarcheological investigation. We hypothesized that growth lines in
   hair might archive the biologic rhythms, growth rate, and metabolism
   during life. Computational modeling predicted the physical appearance,
   derived from hair growth rate, biologic rhythms, and mental state for
   human remains from the Roman period. The width of repeat growth
   intervals (RI's) on the hair, shown by confocal microscopy, allowed
   computation of time series of periodicities of the RI's to model growth
   rates of the hairs. Our results are based on four hairs from controls
   yielding 212 data points and the RI's of six cropped hairs from Zweeloo
   woman's scalp yielding 504 data points. Hair growth was, ten times
   faster than normal consistent with hypertrichosis. Cantu syndrome
   consists of hypertrichosis, dyschondrosteosis, short stature, and
   cardiomegaly. Sympathetic activation and enhancedmetabolic state
   suggesting arousal was also present. Two-photon microscopy visualized
   preserved portions of autonomic nerve fibers surrounding the hair bulb.
   Scanning electron microscopy found evidence that a knifewas used to cut
   the hair three to five days before death. Thus computational modeling
   enabled the elucidation of life's activities 2000 years after death in
   this individual with Cantu syndrome. This may have implications for
   archeology and forensic sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Super-resolution chemical imaging via Raman spectroscopy provides a
   significant ability to simultaneously or pseudo-simultaneously monitor
   numerous label-free analytes while elucidating their spatial
   distribution on the surface of the sample. However, spontaneous Raman is
   an inherently weak phenomenon making trace detection and thus
   super-resolution imaging extremely difficult, if not impossible. To
   circumvent this and allow for trace detection of the few chemical
   species present in any sub-diffraction limited resolution element of an
   image, we have developed a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
   coherent fiber-optic imaging bundle probe consisting of 30,000
   individual fiber elements. When the probes are tapered, etched and
   coated with metal, they provide circular Raman chemical images of a
   sample with a field of view of approximately 20 mu m (i.e. diameter) via
   the array of 30,000 individual 50 nm fiber elements. An acousto-optic
   tunable filter is used to rapidly scan or select discrete frequencies
   for multi-or hyperspectral analysis.
   Although the 50nm fiber element dimensions of this probe inherently
   provide spatial resolutions of approximately 100nm, further increases in
   the spatial resolution can be achieved by using a rapid dithering
   process. Using this process, additional images are obtained one-half
   fiber diameter translations in the x- and y- planes. A piezostage drives
   the movement, providing the accurate and reproducible shifts required
   for dithering. Optimal probability algorithms are then used to
   deconvolute the related images producing a final image with a three-fold
   increase in spatial resolution. This paper describes super-resolution
   chemical imaging using these probes and the dithering method as well as
   its potential applications in label-free imaging of lipid rafts and
   other applications within biology and forensics.}},

Abstract = {{Trace evidence is a significant portion of forensic cases. Textile
   fibers are a common form of trace evidence that are gaining importance
   in criminal cases. Currently, qualitative techniques that do not yield
   structural information are primarily used for fiber analysis, but mass
   spectrometry is gaining an increasing role in this field. Mass
   spectrometry yields more quantitative structural information about the
   dye and polymer that can be used for more conclusive comparisons.
   Matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI) is a
   hybrid ambient ionization source being investigated for use in mass
   spectrometric fiber analysis. In this manuscript, IR-MALDESI was used as
   a source for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of a dyed nylon fiber
   cluster and single fiber. Information about the fiber polymer as well as
   the dye were obtained from a single fiber which was on the order of 10
   mu m in diameter. These experiments were performed directly from the
   surface of a tape lift of the fiber with a background of extraneous
   fibers.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into the performance of luminescence-based
   hyperspectral imaging (LHSI) for denim fiber bundle discrimination has
   been conducted. We also explore the potential of nitromethane (CH3NO2)
   -based quenching to improve discrimination, and we determine the
   quenching mechanism. The luminescence spectra (450-850 nm) and images
   from the denim fiber bundles were obtained with excitation at 325 or 405
   nm. LHSI data were recorded in less than 5 s and subsequently assessed
   by principal component analysis or rendered as red, green, blue (RGB)
   component histograms. The results show that LHSI data can be used to
   rapidly and uniquely discriminate between all the fiber bundle types
   studied in this research. These non-destructive techniques eliminate
   extensive sample preparation and allow for rapid hyperspectral image
   collection, analysis, and assessment. The quenching data also revealed
   that the dye molecules within the individual fiber bundles exhibit
   dramatically different accessibilities to CH3NO2.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exhibit a consistent amount of flexible
   properties which endorse them for a larger spectrum of applications in
   biomedicine and related fields. Over the years, silver nanoparticles
   have been subjected to numerous in vitro and in vivo tests to provide
   information about their toxic behavior towards living tissues and
   organisms. Researchers showed that AgNPs have high antimicrobial
   efficacy against many bacteria species including Escherichia coli,
   Neisseria gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis and also viruses. Due to
   their novel properties, the incorporation of silver nanoparticles into
   different materials like textile fibers and wound dressings can extend
   their utility on the biomedical field while inhibiting infections and
   biofilm development. Among the noble metal nanoparticles, AgNPs present
   a series of features like simple synthesis routes, adequate and tunable
   morphology, and high surface to volume ratio, intracellular delivery
   system, a large plasmon field area recommending them as ideal
   biosensors, catalysts or photo-controlled delivery systems. In
   bioengineering, silver nanoparticles are considered potentially ideal
   gene delivery systems for tissue regeneration. The remote triggered
   detection and release of bioactive compounds of silver nanoparticles has
   proved their relevance also in forensic sciences. The authors report an
   up to date review related to the toxicity of AgNPs and their
   applications in antimicrobial activity and biosensors for gene therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Textile fibres were transferred to the hands often living subjects and
   their persistence was determined after hand washing. Average number of
   fibres transferred was 300 +/- 133 (female 288 +/- 92, male 311 +/- 163)
   per 100 cm(2) hand area in the 100 experiments. However the number of
   fibres transferred was not gender dependent but individual dependent.
   The hand texture of subjects was compared with the number of fibres
   transferred but the relationship was not observed. The number of fibres
   transferred varied significantly for the 10 repeated experiments
   performed under the same conditions for the same subject.
   The subjects were then asked to wash their hands with water. One test
   group washed their hands with standing water, and the other with running
   tap water. Afterwards, the number of fibres remaining on the test
   subjects' hands were investigated. Migration of the fibres on the
   surface of the observed hands did occur but total loss of transferred
   fibre after hand washing did not occur. The average number of fibres
   remaining per 100 cm2 hand area was 14 +/- 10 (range = 3-72) for hand
   washing with standing water, and 10 +/- 12 (range = 0-79) for washing
   with running tap water. The results of this study show the possibility
   of finding fibres on the hands of a person involved in a criminal case
   even after hand washing before fibre collection. (C) 2014 Forensic

Abstract = {{We report the forensic engineering study on the non-woven fabrics made
   from poly(lactide-co-glycolide), PLGA, with low toxicity. The
   comprehensive degradation investigations were conducted under abiotic
   conditions. The extent of degradation was monitored by weight loss,
   composition and molar mass changes of the copolymer and by macro- and
   microscopic observations of the sample surfaces. The structure of the
   degradation products was evaluated at the molecular level by
   electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid
   chromatography analysis. The degradation process takes place
   predominantly by the bulk erosion mechanism and rate of release of
   lactic and glycolic acids from the non-woven fabrics is dependent on
   their formation method. Described solvent-free formation method of
   nonwovens from the tin-free PLGA results in biomaterials with higher
   biocompatibility, what is particularly important for their applications.
   Moreover, the continuous release of lactic and glycolic acids from the
   PLGA biomaterials studied allows their gradual removal via biochemical
   processes and prevents local acidification of the body. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We report a microfluidic device and measurement method to perform
   real-time PCR (or qPCR) in a miniaturized configuration for on-chip
   implementation using reaction volumes of less than 20 mu L. The qPCR
   bioreactor is designed as a module to be embedded in an automated
   sample-in/profile-out system for rapid DNA biometrics or human
   identification. The PCR mixture is excited with a 505 nm diode-pumped
   solid-state laser (DPSSL) and the fluorescence build-up is measured
   using optical fibers directly embedded to the sidewalls of the
   microfluidic qPCR bioreactor. We discuss manufacturing and operating
   parameters necessary to adjust the internal surface conditions and
   temperature profiles of the bioreactor and to optimize the yield and
   quality of the PCR reaction for the amplification of 62 bp hTERT intron
   fragments using the commercial Quantifiler (R) kit (Life Technologies,
   Carlsbad, CA) commonly accepted for genotyping analysis. We designed a
   microfluidic device suitable for continuously processing a specimen by
   efficiently mixing the reagents from the kit to a set volume of DNA
   template on chip. Our approach relies on a calibration curve for the
   specific device using control DNA. We successfully applied this method
   to determine the concentration of genomic DNA extracted from a buccal
   swab on separate microfluidic devices which are operated upstream the
   qPCR device and perform buccal swab lysis and buccal DNA extraction. A
   precise correlation between the amount determined on chip and that
   obtained using a commercial cycler is demonstrated.}},

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{187-194}},

Abstract = {{In the past, forensic soil examination was a routine aspect of trace
   evidence examination in forensic science. However, in Australia, the
   apparent need for soil examinations has diminished and with it the
   capability of forensic science laboratories to carry out soil
   examination has been eroded. In recent years, due to soil examinations
   contributing to some high profile investigations, interest in soil
   examinations has been renewed. Routine soil examinations conducted in a
   forensic science laboratory by trace evidence scientists can be
   facilitated if the examinations are conducted using the instrumentation
   routinely used by these examiners. Spectroscopic techniques such as
   visible microspectrophotometry (MSP) and Attenuated Total Reflectance
   (ATR) Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are routinely used
   by trace evidence analysts for the colour and compositional analysis,
   respectively, of forensic items, including paints, fibres, inks and
   toners, tapes, adhesives and other miscellaneous examinations. This
   article presents an examination of the feasibility of using MSP and
   ATR-FTIR as a first step in the forensic comparison of soils with
   particular reference to Australian soil samples. This initial study

Abstract = {{The confirmation of Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in oral fluid
   (OF) is an important issue for assessing Driving Under the Influence of
   Drugs (DUID). The aim of this research was to develop a highly sensitive
   method with minimal sample pre-treatment suitable for the analysis of
   small OF volumes (100 mu L) for the confirmation of cannabinoids in DUID
   cases. Two methods were compared for the confirmation of THC in residual
   OF samples, obtained from a preliminary on-site screening with
   commercial devices. An ultra high performance LC-MS (UHPLC-MS/MS) method
   and an SPME-GC/MS method were hence developed. 100 pi, of the residual
   mixture OF/preservative buffer or neat OF was simply added to 10 mu L of
   THC-D3 (1 mu g/mL) and submitted to the two different analyses: A -
   direct injection of 10 mu L in UHPLC-MS/MS in positive electrospray
   ionisation (ESI) mode and B - sampling for 30 min with SPME (100 pm
   polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS fibre) and direct injection by desorption
   of the fibre in the GC injection port.
   The lowest limit of detection (LLOD) of THC was 2 ng/mL in UHPLC-MS/MS
   and 0.5 ng/mL in SPME-GC/MS. In addition, cannabidiol (CBD) and
   cannabinol (CBN) could be detected in GC/MS equipment at 2 ng/mL, whilst
   in UHPLC-MS/MS the LLOD was 20 ng/mL.
   Both methods were applied to 70 samples coming from roadside tests. By
   SPME-GC/MS analysis, THC was confirmed in 42 samples, whilst CBD was
   detected in 21 of them, along with CBN in 14 samples. THC concentrations
   ranged from traces below the lowest limit of quantification or LLOQ (2
   ng/mL) up to 690 ng/mL (C) 2014 Forensic Science Society. Published by

Abstract = {{This study presents a classification criteria for two-class Cannabis
   seedlings. As the cultivation of drug type cannabis is forbidden in
   Switzerland, law enforcement authorities regularly ask laboratories to
   determine cannabis plant's chemotype from seized material in order to
   ascertain that the plantation is legal or not. In this study, the
   classification analysis is based on data obtained from the relative
   proportion of three major leaf compounds measured by gas-chromatography
   interfaced with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The aim is to discriminate
   between drug type (illegal) and fiber type (legal) cannabis at an early
   stage of the growth.
   A Bayesian procedure is proposed: a Bayes factor is computed and
   classification is performed on the basis of the decision maker
   specifications (i.e. prior probability distributions on cannabis type
   and consequences of classification measured by losses). Classification
   rates are computed with two statistical models and results are compared.
   Sensitivity analysis is then performed to analyze the robustness of
   classification criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To investigate the accuracy of post-mortem diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) for the detection of myocardial infarction (MI) and to demonstrate
   the feasibility of helix angle (HA) calculation to study remodelling of
   myofibre architecture.
   Cardiac DTI was performed in 26 deceased subjects prior to autopsy for
   medicolegal reasons. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
   (MD) were determined. Accuracy was calculated on per-segment (AHA
   classification), per-territory, and per-patient basis, with pathology as
   reference standard. HAs were calculated and compared between healthy
   segments and those with MI.
   Autopsy demonstrated MI in 61/440 segments (13.9 \%) in 12/26 deceased
   subjects. Healthy myocardial segments had significantly higher FA (p <
   0.01) and lower MD (p < 0.001) compared to segments with MI.
   Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that FA (p < 0.10) and MD
   (p = 0.01) with the covariate post-mortem time (p < 0.01) predicted MI
   with an accuracy of 0.73. Analysis of HA distribution demonstrated
   remodelling of myofibre architecture, with significant differences
   between healthy segments and segments with chronic (p < 0.001) but not
   with acute MI (p > 0.05).
   Post-mortem cardiac DTI enablesdifferentiation between healthy and
   infarcted myocardial segments by means of FA and MD. HA assessment
   allows for the demonstration of remodelling of myofibre architecture

Abstract = {{Criminal investigations would be considerably improved if DNA profiles

   from all 5 digits of 34 individuals. DNA was obtained from the
   fingermarks using a swab moistened with Triton-X, and the fibers were
   added directly to one of two commercial DNA profiling kits. All profiles
   were obtained without increasing the number of amplification cycles;
   therefore, our method is ideally suited for adoption by the forensic
   science community. We indicate the use of the technique in a criminal
   case in which a DNA profile was generated from a fingermark on tape that
   was wrapped around a drug seizure. Our direct DNA profiling approach is
   rapid and able to generate profiles from touched items when current
   forensic practices have little chance of success.}},

Abstract = {{Non-contact surface mapping at a distance is interesting in diverse
   applications including industrial metrology, manufacturing, forensics,
   and artifact documentation and preservation. Frequency modulated
   continuous wave (FMCW) laser detection and ranging (LADAR) is a
   promising approach since it offers shot-noise limited
   precision/accuracy, high resolution and high sensitivity. We demonstrate
   a scanning imaging system based on a frequency-comb calibrated FMCW
   LADAR and real-time digital signal processing. This system can obtain
   three-dimensional images of a diffusely scattering surface at stand-off
   distances up to 10.5 m with sub-micrometer accuracy and with a precision
   below 10 mu m, limited by fundamental speckle noise. Because of its
   shot-noise limited sensitivity, this comb-calibrated FMCW LADAR has a
   large dynamic range, which enables precise mapping of scenes with vastly
   differing reflectivities such as metal, dirt or vegetation. The current
   system is implemented with fiber-optic components, but the basic system
   architecture is compatible with future optically integrated, on-chip
   systems. Work of the US government and not subject to copyright.}},

Abstract = {{Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) have been detected in indoor dust in
   many studies, at concentrations spanning several orders of magnitude.
   Limited information is available on the pathways via which BFRs migrate
   from treated products into dust, yet the different mechanisms
   hypothesized to date may provide an explanation for the range of
   reported concentrations. In particular, transfer of BFRs to dust via
   abrasion of particles or fibers from treated products may explain
   elevated concentrations (up to 210 mg g(-1)) of low volatility BFRs like
   decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209). In this study, an indoor dust sample
   containing a low concentration of hexabromocyclododecane, or HBCD, (110
   ng g(-1) Sigma HBCDs) was placed on the floor of an in-house test
   chamber. A fabric curtain treated with HBCDs was placed on a mesh shelf
   3 cm above the chamber floor and abrasion induced using a stirrer bar.
   This induced abrasion generated fibers of the curtain, which
   contaminated the dust, and,HBCD concentrations in the dust increased to
   between 4020 and 52 500 ng g(-1) for four different abrasion experiment
   times. The highly contaminated dust (HBCD at 52 500 ng g(-1)) together
   with three archived dust samples from various UK microenvironments, were
   investigated with forensic microscopy techniques. These techniques
   included Micro X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy, scanning emission
   microscopy coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy with further BFR analysis on LC-MS/MS.
   Using these techniques, fibers or particles abraded from a product
   treated with BFRs were identified in all dust samples, thereby
   accounting for the elevated concentrations detected in the original dust
   (3500 to 88 800 ng g(-1) Sigma HBCD and 24 000 to 1 438 000 ng g(-1) for
   BDE-209). This study shows how test chamber experiments alongside
   forensic microscopy techniques, can provide valuable insights into the
   pathways via which BFRs contaminate indoor dust. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper considers how likelihood ratios can be derived for a
   combination of physical, chemical and isotopic measurements. Likelihood
   ratios were formulated based on the characteristics of a small
   convenience sample of 20 duct tapes. The propositions considered were:
   H-p two samples are from the same batch
   H-d two samples are from different batches.
   The physical and isotopic characteristics of ten rolls of duct tape were
   shown to be consistent throughout each roll. The width and thickness of
   the tapes and the density of the scrim fibres provided equivalent
   information and the combined physical characteristics provided a basis
   upon which to discriminate between many of the samples. Scatter-plots
   and confidence ellipses provided a convenient method to group the
   isotopic composition of the tape backing material and provided a basis
   to discriminate between samples which were physically indistinguishable.
   Considering both the physical and isotopic characteristics it was
   possible, at best, to ascertain that the evidence provided moderately
   strong support for the proposition that two samples of tape were derived
   from the same batch (LR = 400).
   Kernel density estimates were used to model the distribution of isotopic
   compositions of the backing material. Using this technique it was
   possible to estimate objectively the probability that a sample with
   given characteristics could be drawn, at random, from the background
   population and to calculate a likelihood ratio based on the propositions
   above.
   The strength of evidence which could be presented by either model was
   ultimately limited by the size of the background sample. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{The usefulness of the photo-beaching technique in reducing the
   fluorescence background in Raman spectra of automotive paints was
   studied. The method was applied to group of 20 blue solid and metallic
   paints, in which pigment identification with the use of a green laser
   (514.5 nm) was not possible due to strong fluorescence. The samples were
   irradiated by high laser power for a long period of time before
   acquiring spectra. The process of bleaching was studied in detail based
   on two samples. Then the procedure was applied to all samples before
   acquiring spectra. Due to irradiation fluorescence originating from the
   background decreased, whereas Raman scattering features of samples
   stayed unchanged. The applied procedure satisfactorily quenched
   fluorescence in 90\% of examined samples and made pigment identification
   possible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on an analysis of 19 mummified Maori heads (mokomokai) referred to
   our forensic laboratory for anthropological analysis prior to their
   official repatriation from France to New Zealand, and data from the
   anthropological and medical literature, we propose a complete forensic
   procedure for the analysis of such pieces. A list of 12 original
   morphological criteria was developed. Items included the sex, age at
   death, destruction of the skull base, the presence of argil deposits in
   the inner part of the skull, nostrils closed with exogenous material,
   sewing of eyelids and lips, pierced earlobes, ante-mortem and/or
   post-mortem tattoos, the presence of vegetal fibers within nasal
   cavities, and other pathological or anthropological anomalies. These
   criteria were tested for all 19 mokomokai repatriated to New Zealand by
   the French authorities. Further complementary analyses were limited to
   fiberscopic examination of the intracranial cavities because of the
   taboo on any sampling requested by the Maori authorities. In the context
   of global repatriation of human artifacts to native communities, this
   type of anthropological expertise is increasingly frequently requested
   of forensic anthropologists and other practitioners. We discuss the
   reasons for and against repatriating non-authentic artifacts to such
   communities and the role played by forensic anthropologists during the
   authentication process.}},

Abstract = {{A hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME), used in
   three-phase mode, and combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS), was developed to quantify antidepressants and their major
   metabolites (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine,
   clomipramine, desmethylclomipramine, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine) in
   whole blood samples, using their deuterated analogs as internal
   standards. The HF-LPME system comprised a disposable 8-cm polypropylene
   porous hollow fiber, 4.0 ml of sample solution (0.5 ml of blood added to
   3.5 ml of 0.1 M NaOH: donor phase), dodecane (organic phase), and 0.1 M
   formic acid (acceptor phase) for extraction. After stirring the system,
   the acceptor phase was evaporated under a nitrogen stream and
   resuspended in 30 mu l of methanol. Derivatization was not required. A
   2.0-mu l aliquot of this solution was injected into a GC-MS system. The
   method was validated after the optimization of several parameters that
   may influence the extraction efficiency. The limits of quantification
   for all antidepressants were below the therapeutic levels (20.0 ng/ml).
   The average intraday and interday precisions were within 9.7 and 9.8 \%,
   respectively, for all analytes. The calibration curves were linear in
   the concentration range of 20-1,200 ng/ml. The developed method was
   applied to seven actual postmortem samples. Tricyclic antidepressants
   were detected in all of the analyzed cases. To our knowledge, this is
   the first demonstration of usefulness of HF-LPME for analysis of
   antidepressants in postmortem forensic cases.}},

Abstract = {{Marijuana abuse can be detected by means of toxicological analysis of

   samples. The aim of this study is the establishment of the detailed
   procedure for analysis of THC-COOH in urine by combination of hollow
   fiber-liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS). The conditions of hydrolysis and extraction were
   optimized. The method was shown to be very simple and rapid, and a low
   amount of organic solvent was necessary for extraction. The limit of
   detection was 1.5 ng/ml. The calibration curves were linear over the
   specified range (2.0-170 ng/ml; r (2) > 0.99). The main sources of
   uncertainty were found to be analyte concentration, accuracy, method
   precision and sample volume. The effect of the analyte concentration on
   the overall combined uncertainty was most significant. The developed
   method was successfully applied to a human urine standard reference
   material at two levels of concentration. The obtained relative combined
   uncertainty was 8 \%, which can be considered acceptable according to
   international guidelines. The present method seems very useful in
   clinical and forensic toxicology, because of its simplicity, rapidness

Abstract = {{Identification methods for single textile fibers are in demand for
   forensic applications, and nondestructive methods with minimal
   pretreatment have the greatest potential for utility. Excitation
   emission luminescence data provide a three-dimensional matrix for
   comparison of single-fiber dyes, and these data are enhanced by
   principal component analysis and comparison of fibers using a
   statistical figure of merit. No dye extraction methods are required to
   sample the spectra from a single fiber. This approach has been applied
   to the analysis of single fibers to compare closely matched dye pairs,
   acid blue (AB) 25 and 41 and direct blue (DB) 1 and 53. In all cases,
   the accuracy of fiber identification was high and no false positive
   identifications were made.}},

Abstract = {{A significant amount of research has been carried out on fibres to aid
   the forensic scientist in determining the significance of these when
   found on a victim or suspect. This work has focused on open-air
   environments, and as such no research has been undertaken to examine the
   persistence of fibres on bodies in the burial environment.
   Wool and cotton fibres, known to fluoresce under ultraviolet (UV) light,
   were transferred onto the skin of four porcine (Sus scrofa) carcasses
   (two carcasses per fibre type). The number of fibres transferred was
   recorded from images taken under UV light. The remains were subsequently
   placed in four burial sites and left interred for 14 days. After this
   period the carcasses were excavated and lightly brushed down to remove
   the soil layer that had adhered to the skin. Once again photography
   under UV light was used to record the number of fibres which persisted
   on the skin.
   Results showed that after 14 days, wool and cotton fibres remain on the
   surface of the buried carcasses. In no circumstance was there a total
   loss of fibres suggesting that in such scenarios, the likelihood of
   finding fibres is high but the initial number of fibres transferred
   would be strongly diminished. This has important implications for both
   the excavation protocol for buried remains and the subsequent analysis
   for physical evidence. (C) 2014 The Chartered Society of Forensic

Abstract = {{The judiciary needs forensic medicine to determine the difference
   between an entry hole and an exit hole in human skin caused by firearms
   for civilian use. This important information would be most useful if a
   practical and accurate method could be done with low-cost and minimal
   technological resources. Both macroscopic and microscopic analyses were
   performed on skin lesions caused by firearm projectiles, to establish
   histological features of 14 entry holes and 14 exit holes.
   Microscopically, in the abrasion area macroscopically observed, there
   were signs of burns (sub-epidermal cracks and keratinocyte necrosis) in
   the entrance holes in all cases. These signs were not found in three
   exit holes which showed an abrasion collar, nor in other exit holes.
   Some other microscopic features not found in every case were limited
   either to entry holes, such as cotton fibres, grease deposits, or
   tattooing in the dermis, or to exit holes, such as adipose tissue, bone
   or muscle tissue in the dermis. Coagulative necrosis of keratinocytes
   and sub-epidermal cracks are characteristic of entry holes. Despite the
   small sample size, it can be safely inferred that this is an important
   microscopic finding, among others less consistently found, to define an
   entry hole in questionable cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of

   alleles (BT and BD). The homozygous BT/BT genotype underlies the

   phenotype is induced by the heterozygous state (BT/BD). Using PCR-based
   markers in two segregating populations, we proved that the THCA synthase
   gene represents the postulated B locus and that specific sequence
   polymorphisms are absolutely linked either to the THC-predominant or the
   THC-intermediate chemotype. The absolute linkage provides an excellent
   reliability of the marker signal in forensic casework. For validation,

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fiber analysis and comparison by
   spectral and polymer molecular weight determination was investigated.
   Plain fibers of PET, a common textile fiber and plastic material was
   chosen for this study. The fibers were analyzed for morphological (SEM
   and AFM), spectral (IR and NMR), thermal (DSC) and molecular weight (MS
   and GPC) differences. Molecular analysis of PET fibers by Gel Permeation
   Chromatography (GPC) allowed the comparison of fibers that could not be
   otherwise distinguished with high confidence. Plain PET fibers were
   dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and analyzed by GPC using
   hexafluoroisopropanol:chloroform 2:98 v/v as eluent. 14 PET fiber
   samples, collected from various commercial producers, were analyzed for
   polymer molecular weight by GPC. Distinct differences in the molecular
   weight of the different fiber samples were found which may have
   potential use in forensic fiber comparison. PET fibers with average
   molecular weights between about 20,000 and 70,000 g moL(-1) were
   determined using fiber concentrations in HFIP as low as 1 mu g mL(-1).
   This GPC analytical method can be applied for exclusively distinguish
   between PET fibers using 1 mu g of fiber. This method can be extended to
   forensic comparison of other synthetic fibers such as polyamides and
   acrylics. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Forensic biomechanics is increasingly being used to explain
   how observed injuries occur. We studied infant rib fractures from a
   biomechanical and morphological perspective using a porcine model.
   Methods: We used 24, 6th ribs of one day old domestic pigs Sus scrofa,
   divided into three groups, desiccated (representing post-mortem trauma),
   fresh ribs with intact periosteum (representing peri-mortem trauma) and
   those stored at -20 degrees C. Two experiments were designed to study
   their biomechanical behaviour fracture morphology: ribs were axially
   compressed and subjected to four-point bending in an Instron 3339 fitted
   with custom jigs. Morphoscopic analysis of resultant fractures consisted
   of standard optical methods, micro-CT (mu CT) and Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM).
   Results: During axial compression fresh ribs did not fracture because of
   energy absorption capabilities of their soft and fluidic components. In
   flexure tests, dry ribs showed typical elastic brittle behaviour with
   long linear load-extension curves, followed by short nonlinear elastic
   (hyperelastic) behaviour and brittle fracture. Fresh ribs showed initial
   linear-elastic behaviour, followed by strain softening and visco-plastic
   responses. During the course of loading, dry bone showed minimal
   observable damage prior to the onset of unstable fracture. Frozen then
   thawed bone showed similar patterns to fresh bone. Morphologically,
   fresh ribs showed extensive periosteal damage to the tensile surface
   with areas of collagen fibre pull-out along the tensile surface. While
   all dry ribs fractured precipitously, with associated fibre pull-out,
   the latter feature was absent in thawed ribs.
   Conclusions: Our study highlights the fact that under controlled
   loading, fresh piglet ribs (representing perimortem trauma) did not
   fracture through bone, but was associated with periosteal tearing. These
   results suggest firstly, that complete lateral rib fracture in infants
   may in fact not result from pure compression as has been previously
   assumed; and secondly, that freezing of bone during storage may affect
   its fracture behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical analysis of fire debris represents a crucial part in fire
   investigations to determine the cause of a fire. A headspace solid-phase
   microextraction (HS-SPME) procedure for the detection of ignitable
   liquids in fire debris using a fiber coated with a mixture of three
   different sorbent materials
   (Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane, DVB/CAR/PDMS) is
   described. Gasoline and diesel fuel were spiked upon a preburnt matrix
   (wood charcoal), extracted and concentrated with HS-SPME and then
   analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The
   experimental conditions-extraction temperature, incubation and exposure
   time-were optimized. To assess the applicability of the method, fire
   debris samples were prepared in the smoke density chamber (SDC) and a
   controlled-atmosphere cone calorimeter. The developed methods were
   successfully applied to burnt particleboard and carpet samples. The
   results demonstrate that the procedure that has been developed here is
   suitable for detecting these ignitable liquids in highly burnt debris.}},

Abstract = {{Shahtoosh, the down hair of the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii),
   is the noblest and most expensive wool in the world. The population of
   the animal has declined dramatically due to commercial poaching for the
   fiber. Traditional inspection for detection of shahtoosh has been
   performed by microscopic analysis. We developed a TaqMan real-time
   PCR-based DNA analysis method for identifying shahtoosh fibers. A set of
   probe and primers for the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene that
   binds specifically to Tibetan antelope DNA was designed. A signal was
   detected with sensitivity to the 1:10,000 dilution of shahtoosh DNA. A
   fiber mixture of 1\% of shahtoosh mixed with cashmere and even a single
   fiber can be detected with this method. The method is faster, more
   cost-effective and more sensitive than other traditional sequencing
   methods and can be directly applied to identify shahtoosh and its
   processed products, which will be of value in illegal trade
   investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Raman microscopy is a useful tool for the analysis of drug particles
   collected with adhesive tapes. In this work, first, the spectra of
   thirty drugs of abuse, degradation products, metabolites, and common
   cutting agent standards were recorded and the Raman bands observed were
   summarized providing the forensic analyst useful information for the
   identification of drug evidence. Then, the collection of different drug
   particles by a fingerprint lifting tape commonly used to remove and
   store fingerprints and fibers, and a white and green packaging tape,
   followed by the subsequent identification of the drugs by confocal Raman
   spectroscopy was performed. The particles were analyzed on top of the
   tapes, trapped between glass slides and the tapes, trapped in the tape
   folded over itself in the case of the transparent tape, and after
   folding and unfolding the tape in the case of the colored tape. The
   results obtained by the different approaches show that both tapes did
   not compromise the drugs spectra. However, the use of transparent tape
   is preferred because this tape allows the previous visual detection of
   the particles. Finally, several drug and sugar particles were spread
   over a clean table and inside a pocket, and the particles were collected
   with transparent tape and then properly identified. Although good
   results were obtained in both cases, the amount of fibers and other
   substances present in the collection area made the previous detection of
   the particles difficult and increases the analysis time. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The impregnation of items of clothing with drugs of abuse that are then
   smuggled through airports and ports of entry is a growing problem for
   law enforcement. This work describes the application of portable Raman

   Textile pieces were soaked with the solutions of the drugs then left
   overnight to dry prior to spectroscopic examination. The feasibility of
   detection of the characteristic Raman spectral bands in the presence of
   background matrix signals is demonstrated, even for dyed clothing.
   Definitive evidence for contamination of the items of clothing concerned
   can be acquired within 20-25 s, without any form of sample pre-treatment
   or extraction being necessary. The feasibility of automatic spectral
   recognition of such illicit materials by Raman spectroscopy has been
   investigated by searching a database stored on the spectrometer computer

Abstract = {{Polyneuropathy is defined as a simultaneous malfunction of several

   however, this is reported to occur rarely and difficult to prove. The
   purpose of the study was to introduce for the first time the calorimetry
   in the diagnosis of neuropathy in an experimental animal model. The
   study was inspired by the forensic investigation of a 53-year-old cancer
   survival female patient, in whose case the development of polyneuropathy
   could have been caused by cyclophosphamide therapy. Adult guinea pigs
   were injected intraperitoneally with the dose of cyclophosphamide that
   comparable to the human dosage. Animals were euthanized; nerve and
   muscle samples were analyzed by a SETARAM Micro calorimeter. The
   denaturation temperatures were measured and the calorimetric enthalpies
   were calculated based on the areas under thermal absorption curves. The
   thermal denaturation of the samples decreased and the calorimetric
   enthalpy increased, depending on the therapeutic cyclophosphamide doses.
   The nerves were more sensitive to chemotherapy, compared to the muscles.
   The toxic effects of cyclophosphamide on peripheral nerves and muscles
   can be measured and analyzed by calorimetry, which effects were found
   dose dependent.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{The paleopathological, paleoradiological, histological, molecular and
   forensic investigation of a female mummy (radiocarbon dated 1451-1642
   AD) provides circumstantial evidence for massive skull trauma affecting
   a young adult female individual shortly before death along with chronic
   infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease). The mummy (initially
   assumed to be a German bog body) was localized by stable isotope
   analysis to South America at/near the Peruvian/Northern Chilean coast
   line. This is further supported by New World camelid fibers attached to
   her plaits, typical Inca-type skull deformation and the type of Wormian
   bone at her occiput. Despite an only small transverse wound of the
   supraorbital region computed tomography scans show an almost complete
   destruction of face and frontal skull bones with terrace-like margins,
   but without evidence for tissue reaction. The type of destruction
   indicates massive blunt force applied to the center of the face. Stable
   isotope analysis indicates South American origin: Nitrogen and hydrogen
   isotope patterns indicate an extraordinarily high marine diet along with
   C4-plant alimentation which fits best to the coastal area of Pacific
   South America. A hair strand over the last ten months of her life
   indicates a shift to a more ``terrestric{''} nutrition pattern
   suggesting either a move from the coast or a change in her nutrition.
   Paleoradiology further shows extensive hypertrophy of the heart muscle
   and a distended large bowel/rectum. Histologically, in the rectum wall
   massive fibrosis alternates with residual smooth muscle. The latter
   contains multiple inclusions of small intracellular parasites as
   confirmed by immunohistochemical and molecular ancient DNA analysis to
   represent a chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection. This case shows a
   unique paleopathological setting with massive blunt force trauma to the
   skull nurturing the hypothesis of a ritual homicide as previously
   described in South American mummies in an individual that suffered from
   severe chronic Chagas disease.}},

Abstract = {{When exceptionally preserved, hairs, wools, the skin stratum corneum and
   avian feathers can provide a wealth of archaeological and
   paleontological information. Long-term preservation of their information
   potential lies in the taphonomy (long-term behaviour laws) of
   keratin-based fibres and films. Here, we study the microscopic
   properties of archaeological hairs from the mediaeval burial of Marie de
   Bretagne (15th c., Orleans, France) preserved in a temperate
   environment, using complementary laboratory and synchrotron-based
   analytical instruments. We show that (a) the fibrillar keratin content
   of hair is exceptionally well preserved yet with limited degradation of
   the hair outer cortex in some hair strands, (b) exceptional preservation
   is attributed to the diffusion of copper and lead in the hair, (c) a
   posteriori examination led to the discovery of fragments of copper-based
   artefacts. We propose a possible scenario that led to the preservation
   of these tissues and discuss the archaeological interpretation of the
   microtaphonomy of these bioarchaeological remains. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel method is introduced for distinguishing counterfeit banknotes
   from genuine samples. The method is based on analyzing differences in
   the networks of paper fibers. The main tool is a curvelet-based
   algorithm for measuring the distribution of overall fiber orientation
   and quantifying its anisotropy. The use of a couple or more appropriate
   parameters makes it possible to distinguish forgeries from genuine
   samples as concentrated point clouds in a two- or three-dimensional
   parameter space. Furthermore, the techniques of making watermarks is
   investigated by comparing genuine and counterfeit (sic)50 banknotes. In
   addition, the so-called wire markings are shown to differ significantly
   from each other in all of investigated banknotes.}},

Abstract = {{Premature cracking of concrete bridge parapets is a potentially complex
   problem, with several possible causes. The objectives of this study were
   to determine the reasons for uncontrolled concrete bridge parapet
   cracking and to provide recommendations to the Ohio Department of
   Transportation to prevent such cracking in the future. Potential factors
   examined in this study included properties of the concrete mixtures
   used, construction methods, joint details, composite structural action,
   and durability of the concrete and reinforcement. A total of 22 test
   bridge parapets were or will be constructed as part of this project to
   evaluate different approaches to address premature bridge parapet
   cracking. Both the use of polypropylene fibers and deep saw cuts through
   glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcement provided positive
   results for preventing early-age cracking. The use of fibers prevented
   the occurrence of any shrinkage or temperature cracking even though the
   control joints did not appear to function as designed in early
   observations. Performing a deeper saw cut of 3 1/2 in. (89 mm) and
   cutting through the horizontal GFRP reinforcement allowed the control
   joints to crack easily, mitigating cracking elsewhere on the parapet.
   The most optimal design of a bridge parapet thus far seems to be
   including GFRP rebar as the horizontal reinforcement in the parapet to
   make a deeper saw cut for the control joints. At this point, none of the
   cracks between joints that were observed during the previous forensic
   study have been found on these new bridges.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual offences are under-reported and ascertaining accurate offence
   numbers is difficult. Any methods which could increase the ability to
   obtain biological evidence or reduce the additional distress associated
   with reporting a sexual offence may result in an increase in reporting
   this crime type. The Evidence Recovery System (ERS) is designed to
   collect trace evidence, including hairs, fibres and biological evidence,
   from bath or shower water in a non-invasive manner. Initially, samples
   of semen were placed in baths filled with water, and washing was
   simulated using a range of body wash products. The water was then
   drained through the ERS before its filters were subjected to acid
   phosphatase testing and haematoxylin and eosin staining of spermatozoa.
   Recovered spermatozoa were then graded accordingly. Following this, the
   experiment was repeated with the addition of dirt/dust particulates
   during the washing stage, to simulate recovery of biological evidence in
   a more realistic environment. The results showed that spermatozoa
   considered `easy to find' could regularly be obtained from bathwater
   using the ERS. It appeared that this recovery was not affected by the
   presence of different body wash products. When dust/dirt particles were
   added, the number of spermatozoa recovered increased at two of the
   evidence collection stages. The difference in recovery was considered to
   be statistically significant. This study provides evidence to suggest
   the feasibility of use of the ERS as a method to collect semen evidence
   from individuals subjected to sexual offences. The recovery of
   spermatozoa does not appear to be affected by the presence of a body
   wash, but does appear to be improved when skin cells, hair and other
   debris are transferred into the water, as would be likely during a
   bath/shower. Further to this, the possibility of obtaining spermatozoa
   from the home bath or shower of a victim following a post-offence
   bathing experience is implied. (C) 2014 Forensic Science Society.

Abstract = {{Ballistic damage to the clothing of victims of gunshot wounds to the
   chest can provide useful forensic evidence. Anyone shot in the torso
   will usually be wearing clothing which will be damaged by the
   penetrating impact event and can reportedly be the source of some of the
   debris in the wound. Minimal research has previously been reported
   regarding the effect of bullets on apparel fabrics and underlying
   tissue. This paper examines the effect of ammunition (9 mm full metal
   jacket {[}FMJ] DM11 A1B2, 8.0 g; and soft point flat nose Remington
   R357M3, 10.2 g) on clothing layers that cover the torso (T-shirt,
   T-shirt plus hoodie, T-shirt plus denim jacket) and underlying
   structures represented by porcine thoracic wall (skin, underlying
   tissue, ribs). Impacts were recorded using a Phantom V12 high speed
   camera. Ejected bone debris was collected before wound tracts were
   dissected and measured; any debris found was recovered for further
   analysis. Size and mass of bony debris was recorded; fibre debris
   recovered from the wound and impact damage to fabrics were imaged using
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Remington R357M3 ammunition was
   characteristically associated with stellate fabric damage; individual
   fibres were less likely to show mushrooming. In contrast, 9 mm FMJ
   ammunition resulted in punch-out damage to fabric layers, with
   mushrooming of individual fibres being more common. Entry wound sizes
   were similar for both types of ammunition and smaller than the diameter
   of the bullet that caused them. In this work, the Remington R357M3
   ammunition resulted in larger exit wounds due to the bullet construction
   which mushroomed. That fabric coverings did not affect the amount of
   bony debris produced is interesting, particularly given there was some
   evidence that apparel layers affected the size of the wound. Recent work
   has suggested that denim (representative of jeans) can exacerbate
   wounding caused by high-velocity bullet impacts to the thigh when the
   bullet does not impact the femur. That more bony debris was caused by
   Remington R357M3 rather than 9 mm FMJ ammunition was not surprising
   given the relative constructions of these two bullets, and is of
   interest to medical practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{In forensic applications, traces are often hard to detect and segment
   from challenging substrates at crime scenes. In this paper, we propose
   to use the temporal domain of forensic signals as a novel feature space
   to provide additional information about a trace. In particular we
   introduce a degree of persistence measure and a protocol for its
   computation, allowing for a flexible extraction of time domain
   information based on different features and approximation techniques.
   At the example of latent fingerprints on semi-/porous surfaces and a CWL
   sensor, we show the potential of such approach to achieve an increased
   performance for the challenge of separating prints from background.
   Based on 36 earlier introduced spectral texture features, we achieve an
   increased separation performance (0.01 <= Delta kappa <= 0.13,
   respective 0.6\% to 6.7\%) when using the time domain signal instead of
   spatial segmentation. The test set consists of 60 different prints on
   photographic-, catalogue- and copy paper, acquired in a sequence of ten
   times. We observe a dependency on the used surface as well as the number
   of consecutive images and identify the accuracy and reproducibility of
   the capturing device as the main limitation, proposing additional steps
   for even higher performances in future work.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years several European rope testing laboratories either
   downsized or closed. But the demand for rope testing has increased,
   particularly for application specific testing which models service life
   conditions of ropes, chains and cables. Tension Technology International
   (TTI), a leading consultancy firm in the field, identified this need and
   set up a new testing company: TTI Testing in Wallingford, UK, to provide
   these services to the public.
   This paper discusses the special requirements for testing wire and fiber
   ropes, chains and cables. It describes TTI Testing's specialized test
   equipment. Finally, it presents case studies which show how a carefully
   designed testing program can be used to represent, replicate and
   understand rope behavior in service. This improves understanding can be
   used to improve rope design, predict service life and develop discard
   criteria, and thus lead to safer and more economical operation.
   The paper will be of particular interest to makers and users of wire and
   fiber rope, chain, and cables.}},

Abstract = {{Testability and error rates are fundamental requirements for forensic
   investigations methods. For digitized forensics (e.g. fingerprint or
   fiber traces) signal processing and pattern recognition concepts are
   used. The quality of the acquisition process is sparsely researched. In
   our article we outline a first approach to address this and to open the
   discussion about the general challenge. We propose using Visual Quality
   Indices (VQI) as objective measure to compare scanned (digitized) traces
   for 3 different 3D contactless sensors (intensity + topography data) and
   1 sensor with spectrometer-based wavelength output. We propose a fitness
   matrix containing VQI results for trace data acquired for each sensor
   and suggest using the number of outliers (non-occupied elements of the
   main diagonal) as fitness measure.
   We compare 182 data sets using 4 contactless sensors for 2 consecutive
   scans of 13 traces (3 fingerprints + 10 fibers, with 78 intensity and 78
   topography data sets for the three 3D sensors and 26 for the
   spectography-based wavelength output). We compare the 2 consecutive
   scans vice versa by computing VQIs for all 7 outputs (intensity,
   topography and wavelength output) per trace, yielding 196 (14x14) single
   comparisons per trace and VQI (in all 356720 comparisons). We research
   the best performing VQIs to select intra-sensor, intra-trace data from
   intra- and inter-sensor data, giving a starting point for further
   inter-sensor investigations. Our research shows the Luminance Similarity
   Score (LSS) performing best in intra-sensor, intra-trace scenarios for
   fingerprint traces and Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise
   Ratio (PSNR) and PSNR in the YUV Color Space (PSNRY) equally performing
   best for synthetic fiber traces as a first result for further
   discussion.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of tapelifting as a collection method for touch DNA}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The use of tapelifting for collection of touch DNA from fabrics is
   routine in many jurisdictions. However, there is a paucity of data
   relating to the effectiveness of different types of tapes for
   tapelifting, the amount of tapelifting required to generate a useful
   profile, and whether or not tapelifting is more effective than swabbing
   from various substrates. This research investigates these questions by
   comparing two tapes of different adhesive strength currently used in
   forensic casework (Scotch (R) Magic (TM) tape and Scenesafe FAST (TM)
   minitapes), for sampling from touch deposits on four different
   fabrics-cotton flannelette, cotton drill woven fabric, polyester/cotton
   plain woven fabric and polyester strapping.
   Touch DNA was deposited on four replicates of each substrate. Separate
   areas of each substrate replicate were sampled, either by taping with
   one of the two tapes or by wet/dry swabbing with cotton swabs. Tape was
   applied over the defined sampling area once or repeatedly for various
   numbers of applications. DNA was extracted, quantified and profiled from
   all tape and swab samples as well as the corresponding sampled
   substrates.
   Significantly more DNA was extracted, and a higher proportion of alleles
   detected, from Scenesafe FAST (TM) tape than from Scotch (R) Magic (TM)
   tape. The amount of DNA and number of donor alleles detected generally
   increased as the tape was reapplied to the surface, although a threshold
   of collection was seen for both types of tape. For two out of four
   substrates, taping with Scenesafe FAST (TM) collected more DNA than
   swabbing and, for three substrates, generated a greater median number of
   donor alleles. There was no significant difference in numbers of alleles
   between swabbing and taping from flannelette. Based on these findings,
   it is recommended that a tape with stronger adhesion (such as Scenesafe
   FAST (TM) tapelifters) is generally preferable; that more than one
   application of tape is suggested (however, increasing the amount of
   times the area is sampled can diminish collection efficiency); and that
   there is an advantage using tapelifting rather than swabbing for fabrics
   unless, such as with flannelette, there are many loose fibres easily
   removed during the sampling process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy is a preferred analytical tool for forensic trace
   analysis due to its non-invasive nature. This technique has been
   utilized in examination of organic colorants present in fibers and ink,
   but high fluorescent nature of these compounds is a problem. In the

   quenching fluorescence and enhancing Raman signals, is found to be
   effective as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates for
   analysis of rhodamine 6G (Rh 6G) and crystal violet (CV) dyes.
   As-prepared and well characterized by UV, TEM-EDAX and XRD techniques,
   the investigated silver-doped agarose gel disk proves to have minimal
   invasive as confirmed by the ATR-FTIR method and effective for in situ
   SERS analysis of blue and red ballpoint ink. The disk is stable upon
   storage and hence can be re-used and re-examined. The present method
   offers new possibilities in trace forensic analysis with minimal

Abstract = {{An HPLC-DAD-MS method is described to analyze textile dyes in different
   dye classes (reactive, basic, acid, direct, disperse). The described
   method is sensitive enough to analyze single fibers with a length of a
   few millimeters or less, which makes it suitable for forensic analyses.
   The current paper describes the information content of the acquired data
   as well as the results of a validation study, in which the
   repeatability, specificity, and limit of detection of the method were
   assessed by repeated measurements of nine different dyes in the
   mentioned dye classes. The mass accuracy (deviation generally <2 ppm)
   and absorbance spectra were found to be highly stable in several
   measurements over a period of 8 weeks. Deviation in retention times were
   observed and attributed to small experimental effects and a precolumn
   blockage. The results show that dye analysis is possible for most fibers
   with a minimum length of one or a few millimeters.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate quantitation of ethanol is of great importance in clinical
   and forensic analyses. In the current study, alcohol oxidase (AOX) from
   Pichia pastoris, a multimeric enzyme consisting of eight identical
   sub-units, was immobilized on electrospun polystyrene-co-maleic
   anhydride (PSMA) fibers for valid tests of alcoholic saliva. Branched
   polyethyleneimine (PEI) was grafted on PSMA fibers with a density of
   0.15 nmol/cm(2) as tethers to allow multipoint covalent binding of
   enzyme molecules through glutaraldehyde activation, and the secondary
   and tertiary amino groups of PEI could intensify the interactions with
   AOX subunits to stabilize the quaternary structure. PSMA-PEI-AOX fibers
   were less sensitive than free AOX to the incubation temperature and pH,
   and indicated no detectable subunit release from the immobilized AOX
   after boiling in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and
   2-mercaptoethanol. Color strips were established on PSMA-PEI-AOX fibrous
   mats dyed with indigo Carmine after incubation into ethanol solutions of
   different concentrations. The color fading ratio remained no significant
   change after repeat tests for 9 cycles after immersion in 0.2 and 0.8
   mg/mL of alcoholic saliva. It was indicated that multipoint
   immobilization of the multimeric enzyme was essential to improve the
   enzyme stability by stabilizing both the quaternary structure of the
   enzyme and the structure of each individual subunit. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Headspace gas chromatography, coupled to flame ionization detection
   (GC-FID) analysis of blood alcohol concentration is a routine analysis
   carried out in forensic laboratories. A common concern with this
   analysis is the possible co-elution of a variety of other commonly
   encountered compounds with the target compound ethanol. By use of
   application specific columns, improved separation of ethanol, as well as
   the other potential components can be achieved. The presented method
   includes the evaluation of blood alcohol concentration by both direct
   gas headspace and SPME utilizing a new combination of GC columns. An
   investigation of method detection limits (MDLs) was also conducted in
   order to determine a reporting limit as well as the degree of
   uncertainty at the common threshold value of 0.08 g/dL. The study showed
   that under the conditions of this work, static headspace analysis with
   the use of t-butanol as an internal standard provided the most accurate
   and precise data with an MDL of 0.002 g/dL for the Rtx (R) - BAC PLUS 1
   column and 0.005 g/dL for the Rtx (R) - BAC PLUS 2 column. The study
   also showed that the SPME analysis using a Carboxen/PDMS (65 mu m) fiber

   approximation to the radiative transfer equation, implying that it is
   limited to tissues where the reduced scattering coefficient dominates
   over the absorption coefficient. Nevertheless, up to absorption
   coefficients of 20 mm(-1) at reduced scattering coefficients of 1 and
   11.5 mm(-1), we observed excellent agreement (r(2) = 0.994) between
   reflectance measurements of phantoms and the diffuse reflectance
   equation proposed by Zonios et al. {[}Appl. Opt. 38, 6628-6637 (1999)],
   derived as an approximation to one of the diffusion dipole equations of
   Farrell et al. {[}Med. Phys. 19, 879-888 (1992)]. However, two
   parameters were fitted to all phantom experiments, including strongly
   absorbing samples, implying that the reflectance equation differs from
   diffusion theory. Yet, the exact diffusion dipole approximation at high
   reduced scattering and absorption also showed agreement with the phantom
   measurements. The mathematical structure of the diffuse reflectance
   relation used, derived by Zonios et al. {[}Appl. Opt. 38, 6628-6637
   (1999)], explains this observation. In conclusion, diffuse reflectance
   relations derived as an approximation to the diffusion dipole theory of
   Farrell et al. can analyze reflectance ratios accurately, even for much
   larger absorption than reduced scattering coefficients. This allows
   calibration of fiber-probe set-ups so that the object's diffuse
   reflectance can be related to its absorption even when large. These
   findings will greatly expand the application of diffuse reflection
   spectroscopy. In medicine, it may allow the use of blue/green
   wavelengths and measurements on whole blood, and in forensic science, it
   may allow inclusion of objects such as blood stains and cloth at crime
   scenes. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A simple, compact, and high sensitivity capillary-based probe for the in
   situ detection of fluorescence signals with high sensitivity is
   demonstrated. A home-made single-multi-mode fiber coupler that is
   coaxially aligned with the capillary-based probe provides for the
   transmission of excitation light and the collection and transmission of
   fluorescence. We propose a conceptually straightforward theoretical
   model to optimize the factors affecting the fluorescence-capture
   capability of the capillary-based probe. The fluorescence signal
   detected by fiber-optic spectroscopy non-linearly increases with the
   length of the capillary-based probe. In addition, the thicker the
   capillary tube wall is, the less the fluorescence signals determined
   are. The performance of the proposed probe is evaluated experimentally
   by measuring the fluorescence spectra of Cy5.5 dye and blue-green algae.
   The experimental results show that the proposed probe provides more than
   a ten-fold increase in fluorescence signal compared with direct
   measurements by a flat-tipped multi-mode fiber probe. The advantages of
   the capillary-based probe, which include its simple and compact
   structure, excellent light collection efficiency, requirement of small
   sample volume, and recoverability of samples, allow its wide application
   to in situ detection in the medical, forensic, biological, geological,
   and environmental fields with high sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal recessive disorder,
   characterized by papular skin lesions and cutaneous laxity caused by
   fragmentation and mineralization of elastic fibers. Although vascular
   and retinal aspects of this disease and their associated complications
   are well characterized, few authors have focused on the increased
   incidence of epilepsy in patients with PXE. A 28-year-old Korean male
   was found dead in his work place with bloody-foamy discharge from his
   mouth and nostrils. He reportedly had a convulsive episode 5 days prior
   to his death in the work place. The skin showed generalized laxity and
   many creases with maculopapular pigmentations. A histopathologic
   examination of the skin revealed Pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Based on the
   histopathological findings and medical history, death was postulated to
   be due to `an internal cause, possibly related to a seizure attack'. Our
   findings suggest that histopathologic examinations of any lesions found
   during the forensic autopsy should be encouraged. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd

   and judicial systems is discussed. The records of the 172 strangulation
   patients seen in our forensic nurse examiner program between 2009 and
   2010 were reviewed. The SPEX Crimescope (SPEX Forensics, Edison, New
   Jersey) was used during the assessment of all of them. Ninety-three
   percent of the patients had no visible evidence of external injuries on
   physical examination. The ALS revealed positive findings of intradermal
   injuries in 98\% of that group. Information obtained with ALS devices
   helps medical and nursing practitioners understand the gravity of
   patients' injuries, influences medical treatment decisions and follow-up

Abstract = {{We report the case of a 70-year-old woman found dead in her apartment in
   the South of Italy in February 2011.
   The detailed data showed that the victim was affected by familiar-type
   paranoid schizophrenia. This finding was confirmed by the discovery of
   antipsychotic and tricyclic antidepressant drugs in the house and the
   deposition of her psychiatric therapist.
   Before the autopsy, a multislice computed tomography (MSCT) scanning of
   the thoracic and facial maxillo-cervical area was performed that has
   allowed anatomical identification and diagnosis of a mechanical
   obstruction as the cause of death. The autopsy has showed the presence
   of materials obstructing the trachea totally. Histological and
   toxicological investigations were carried out on the victim. The
   toxicological investigation has shown the presence of metabolites of
   tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics in the blood and urine. The
   histology showed the presence of foreign-origin materials (starch
   fibres) inside the pulmonary alveolus. The cause of death was asphyxia
   due to obstruction by food-origin material. In this case the
   radiological data have been compared with the autopsy and toxicological
   and histological data. The comparison of results has shown that MSCT
   scanning may aid in identification of occlusion and then in
   determination of the cause of death. In conclusion, MSCT scanning can be
   proposed in the cases of suspected asphyxia, as the screening procedure
   of first instance to produce preliminary information useful to rapidly
   develop the successive autopsy performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{This study investigated a new method of fibre recovery from non-textile
   items using polystyrene rods which have a static charge. A range of
   natural and man-made fibres were used on a number of substrates,
   including weapons, paper and plastic bags. The average recovery rate
   from all substrates was 99.1\%. The effect of humidity on fibre recovery
   was also studied and it was found to reduce the ability of the rods to
   recover fibres. However this is unlikely to be an issue if recovery
   takes place in a forensic laboratory. It was concluded that the rods
   would prove a beneficial addition to the forensic laboratory as a
   relatively quick method of fibre recovery from non textile items where
   the standard method of recovery using tape lifts cannot be used. (C)

Abstract = {{Fibers are a commonly encountered evidence type and fiber comparisons

   known fibers correspond, the probative value is limited because the
   characteristics compared are determined by their manufacture. It would
   be valuable to test the hypothesis that questioned fibers originated
   from a specific carpet. One means of testing this is to analyze fine
   particles on the fibers. A procedure was developed for removing adhering
   particles from fibers and preparing them for scanning electron
   microscopy/ energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS) analysis. The
   efficacy of several fluids (acetone, ethanol, hexanes, aqueous ethanol,
   aqueous sodium hexametaphosphate) and agitation methods (sonication and
   vortexing) for removing particles from fibers was evaluated. The most
   effective method evaluated was sonication in ethanol for 10min. The
   recovered particles were filtered onto a polycarbonate filter and
   analyzed by automated SEM/EDS analysis to generate data on the particle
   assemblage. This method makes possible future research to test the
   within-item and between-item variability of particle assemblages on

   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber was used to isolate the analytes.
   Parameters of HS-SPME, analytes desorption and GC-FID were selected and
   an analytical procedure is proposed. Under the optimum conditions the
   limits of detection were in the range of 2.0-13 mu g L-1 and the
   relative standard deviations were between 2.6 and 14\%. The developed
   analytical method was successfully applied to the analysis of water
   contaminated by unleaded petrol and unfiltered water used to extinguish
   a simulated fire. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many researchers have been working in Spain to document the communal
   graves of those assassinated during the Spanish Civil War. This article
   shows the results obtained with two low-cost photogrammetric techniques
   for the basic documentation of forensic studies. These low-cost
   techniques are based on single-image rectification and the correction of
   the original photo displacement due to the projection and perspective
   distortions introduced by the lens of the camera. The capability of
   image rectification is tested in an excavation in the village of Loma de
   Montija (Burgos, Spain). The results of both techniques are compared
   with the more accurate data obtained from a laser scanner system RIEGL
   LMS-Z390i to evaluate the error in the lengths. The first technique uses
   a camera situated on a triangle-shaped pole at a height of 5m and the
   second positions the camera over the grave using a linearly actuated
   device. The first technique shows measurement errors less than 6\%,
   whereas the second shows greater errors (between 8\% and 14\%) owing to
   the positioning of the carbon-fiber cross on an uneven surface.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Polyneuropathy is defined as a simultaneous malfunction of
   several peripheral nerves, which could be a toxic side effect of cancer
   therapy; however, this is reported to occur rarely and difficult to
   confirm. Aims: The purpose of the study was to introduce, at the first
   time, the calorimetry in the diagnosis of neuropathy in an experimental
   animal model. The study was inspired by the forensic investigation of a
   53-year-old cancer survivor female patient, in whom the development of
   polyneuropathy could be caused by cyclophosphamide therapy. Methods:
   Adult guinea pigs were injected intraperitoneally with the dose of
   cyclophosphamide, comparable to the human dosage. Animals were
   euthanized, then nerve and muscle samples were analyzed using a SETARAM
   Micro calorimeter. Denaturation temperatures were measured and the
   calorimetric enthalpies were calculated based on the areas under thermal
   absorption curves. Results: Thermal denaturations of the samples were
   decreased and the calorimetric enthalpies were increased depending on
   the doses of cyclophosphamide. The nerves were more sensitive to
   chemotherapy as compared to the muscles. Conclusion: It is concluded
   that toxic effects of cyclophosphamide on peripheral nerves and muscles
   can be measured and analysed by calorimetry, and that the effect was
   dose dependent. Orv. Hetil., 2013, 154, 510-515.}},

Abstract = {{The measured mechanical and physical properties of copper-alumina
   (Cu-Al2O3) composites are influenced by the defects induced during the
   manufacturing of the test samples. In this paper we shall demonstrate
   how the fundamental knowledge of the influence of the amount and type of
   micro-cracks on the mechanical and thermal properties of copper-alumina
   composites can be used as a forensic tool in identifying the defects
   induced during the manufacturing process of the test samples. This
   process involves several steps; the preparation of ingots from
   commercial powders by hot iso-static pressing (HIP), followed by their
   machining, hot extrusion, heat treatment, and if necessary further
   machining to make specimens of desired shape. Each step in this
   manufacturing process introduces some defects, so that the mechanical
   and physical properties measured using these samples, such as the Young
   modulus, the thermal conductivity and the coefficient of thermal
   expansion can be very different from the expected values, despite the
   fact that the density of the composite measured on the same samples is
   very close to its theoretical value. As a result open porosity is not
   the likely cause and it is reasonable to suspect that closed pores (e.g.
   micro-cracks) in the copper matrix and at the interfaces of the alumina
   inclusions formed during the multi-stage manufacture of test samples are
   responsible for the differences in the measured and expected mechanical
   and thermal properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since its inception in 1995, solvent-microextraction (SME) techniques
   for sample preparation have grown increasingly popular due to their
   simplicity, low cost, and adaptability to a wide variety of sample types
   and analytes. SME methods are used alone or as final clean-up and
   concentration techniques in preparing environmental, clinical, forensic,
   personal-care, pharmaceutical and food-product samples.
   There are two broad categories of SME: exposed-solvent and
   membrane-protected solvent techniques. The principal exposed-drop
   techniques include single-drop microextraction (SDME), headspace
   single-drop microextraction (HS-SDME), liquid-liquid microextraction
   (LLME), liquid-liquid-liquid microextraction (LLLME) and dispersive
   liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME). The principal membrane-protected
   modes are hollow-fiber-protected 2-phase microextraction {[}HF(2)ME] and
   hollow-fiber-protected 3-phase microextraction {[}HF(3)ME].
   In recent years, interest in SME has increasingly turned to refinements
   of these modes for use in practical sample preparations. This has
   involved innovations (e.g., ionic liquids, ultrasonic-assisted
   emulsification, automation, and low-density solvents for DLLME).
   In this review, we explore these and other SME innovations appearing in
   the literature in the period from mid-2010 to mid-2012. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The forensic analysis of textile fibers uses a variety of techniques
   from microscopy to spectroscopy. One such technique that is often used
   to identify the dye(s) within the fiber is mass spectrometry (MS). In
   the traditional MS method, the dye must be extracted from the fabric and
   the dye components are separated by chromatography prior to mass
   spectrometric analysis. Direct analysis of the dye from the fabric
   allows the omission of the lengthy sample preparation involved in
   extraction, thereby significantly reducing the overall analysis time.
   Herein, a direct analysis of dyed textile fabric was performed using the
   infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization
   (IR-MALDESI) source for MS. In MALDESI, an IR laser with wavelength
   tuned to 2.94 mu m is used to desorb the dye from the fabric sample with
   the aid of water as the matrix. The desorbed dye molecules are then
   postionized by electrospray ionization (ESI). A variety of dye classes
   were analyzed from various fabrics with little to no sample preparation
   allowing for the identification of the dye mass and in some cases the
   fiber polymer. Those dyes that were not detected using MALDESI were also
   not observed by direct infusion ESI of the dye standard.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical instruments based on InfraRed Absorption Spectroscopy (IRAS)
   and Gas Chromatography (GC) are today available only as bench-top
   instrumentation for forensic labs and bulk analysis. Within the `DIRAC'
   project funded by the European Commission, we are developing an advanced
   portable sensor, that combines miniaturized GC as its key chemical
   separation tool, and IRAS in a Hollow Fiber (HF) as its key analytical
   tool, to detect and recognize illicit drugs and key precursors, as bulk
   and as traces. The HF-IRAS module essentially consists of a broadly
   tunable External Cavity (EC) Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL),
   thermo-electrically cooled MCT detectors, and an infrared hollow fiber
   at controlled temperature. The hollow fiber works as a miniaturized gas
   cell, that can be connected to the output of the GC column with minimal
   dead volumes. Indeed, the module has been coupled to GC columns of
   different internal diameter and stationary phase, and with a Vapour
   Phase Pre-concentrator (VPC) that selectively traps target chemicals
   from the air. The presentation will report the results of tests made
   with amphetamines and precursors, as pure substances, mixtures, and
   solutions. It will show that the sensor is capable of analyzing all the
   chemicals of interest, with limits of detection ranging from a few
   nanograms to about 100-200 ng. Furthermore, it is suitable to deal with
   vapours directly trapped from the headspace of a vessel, and with salts
   treated in a basic solution. When coupled to FAST GC columns, the module
   can analyze multi-components mixes in less than 5 minutes.}},

Abstract = {{Since the first coupling of laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma to
   mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) in 1985, applications of this analytical
   technique in various scientific fields have been developed. LA-ICP-MS is
   an elemental and isotopic microanalytical technique that is increasingly
   used for routine analysis in forensic laboratories around the world due
   to its great discriminating power between samples and its capacity for
   analyzing solid evidence of small size. In addition, its
   quasi-non-destructive character is especially welcome for this type of
   sample.
   The main forensic applications of LA-ICP-MS have been developed for
   glass and paint samples. However, applications to other samples have
   also been reported {[}e.g., documents (ink and paper), fibers, cannabis,
   gems, Australian ocher and porcelain, brick stones, and gold and
   silver]. In the forensic field, the adjustment of instrumental
   analytical parameters, the study of interferences produced by
   fractionation and polyatomic ions, and the statistical treatment of data
   are considered of great importance. This review is intended as a
   practical, useful guide to help forensic chemists incorporate this
   attractive, powerful technique into their laboratories. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{We have developed a high-throughput microscope for wavelength-tunable
   microscopic studies of materials by Raman, surface-enhanced Raman,
   fluorescence, and reflectance spectroscopy. Narrow-band excitation over
   a broad tuning range (410-2200 nm) is provided by a solid-state,
   compact, and relatively inexpensive new class of diode-pumped Nd:YAG
   optical parametric oscillator emitting approximately 1-mJ, 10-ns pulses
   at a rate up to 100Hz. Rayleigh rejection over the tuning range is
   obtained with an array of angle-tuned custom dielectric filters.
   Although high-power, low duty-cycle light sources have so far had only
   very limited use for tunable Raman and surface-enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy, we show that undesirable nonlinear effects that arise from
   the high peak power of the output can be mitigated to produce good
   results with the proper choice of additional microscope elements.
   Measurements can be performed across the visible range with 20\%
   sample-to-detector throughput and 10 cm(-1) resolution. The system is
   also fitted with a fiber optic imaging system to perform fluorescence
   and reflectance spectroscopy measurements with a spatial resolution of 5
   mu m. We demonstrate the instrument's analytical capabilities by
   recording resonance Raman and surface-enhanced Raman emissions from a
   commercial lake pigment and crystal violet, respectively, colorants of
   interest in cultural heritage studies and forensic science. We also
   isolate and measure the reflectance spectrum of a commercial lake
   pigment and the ultraviolet fluorescence spectrum of a single fiber of
   cochineal-dyed silk. The tunability, flexibility, compactness, and
   spatial resolution of the device provide novel capability for
   multianalytic materials research in fields such as forensic science and
   cultural heritage studies. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The use of radiocarbon in forensics is by now widespread, thanks to the
   so-called bomb peak, which makes it possible to perform high-precision
   dating. Since 1955, C-14 concentration in the atmosphere had strongly
   increased due to nuclear explosions, reaching its maximum value in
   1963-1965. After the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, C-14 started to decrease
   as a consequence of the exchanges between atmosphere and the other
   natural carbon reservoirs. Nowadays, it is still slightly above the
   pre-bomb value. The work presented in this paper is based on the idea of
   exploiting the bomb peak to ``precisely{''} date works of contemporary
   art, with the aim at identifying possible fakes.
   We analysed two kinds of materials from the 20th century: newspapers and
   painting canvases. Newspaper samples were taken because they might in
   principle be considered to represent dated samples (considering the date
   on the issues). Our data (28 samples) show a trend similar to
   atmospheric data in the literature, although with some differences; the
   paper peak is flatter and shifted towards more recent years (about five
   years) with respect to the atmospheric data. This can be explained by
   taking paper manufacturing processes into account, As to the canvas
   samples, the measured C-14 concentrations were generally reasonably
   consistent with the expected concentrations (based on the year on the
   paintings). However, this does not indicate that the interpretation of
   the results is simpler and more straightforward. Obviously, we only
   measure the C-14 concentration of the fibre used for the canvas, which
   does not necessarily measure the date the painting was manufactured.
   In this paper, sample preparation and experimental results will be
   discussed, in order to show the potential as well as the limitations of
   radiocarbon to date contemporary art. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Fourth year students in the baccalaureate program in chemical
   engineering at my college are required to perform faculty-supervised
   original experimental research in any area of science and engineering.
   As the college comprises faculties in engineering, design, and art, my
   goal was to introduce my research students to one of the more humanistic
   areas of science - the scientific study of ancient cultural heritage
   objects and related technologies. This is accomplished by applying
   high-tech science using modern chemical instrumentation to the study and
   understanding of one of the technologies practiced in antiquity. This
   artistic and scientific technological craft is the production of color
   on an object, whether by the dyeing of textiles or by the painting of
   walls and vessels.
   The study of the natural colorants used in antiquity opens a historical
   window to one of the most fascinating chapters in the field of ancient
   technologies. Such an investigation involves an interdisciplinary
   approach that combines history, archaeology, art, religion, botany,
   entomology, malacology, and forensic-style analytical research. The
   results of the analyses of ancient dyes and pigments can lead to a
   better understanding of international commerce in antiquity, especially
   in the flow of dyestuffs, dyed goods, and of dyeing technologies from
   one geographical region to another. The ``fashionable colors{''} of
   ancient peoples can be better visualized by studying the chemical
   constitution of these colorants through the centuries from the various
   archaeological textiles of different eras that have survived the ravages
   of time.
   The optimum analytical method to be used in the analysis of organic dyes
   and pigments is the high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)
   technique, which must be preceded by a correct dye micro-extraction
   procedure
   . Though this method essentially destroys the sample, it is
   nano-destructive and more than any other method extracts the maximum
   information regarding the origin of the dyestuff used. This method has
   been successfully used on such miniscule samples as single dissected
   fibers from a yarn, whereby the dye quantity was on the order of a
   nanogram - a billionth of a gram! Though the students apply the
   techniques to very specific items, they learn a number of universal
   skills that can be applied to many different fields in their future
   professional careers. These proficiencies include micro-sampling of the
   objects for the analyses and handling such miniscule samples;
   understanding the principles of chromatography in general, and liquid
   chromatography in particular; being able to critically interpret the
   scientific results by knowing what qualitative and quantitative data can
   be accepted or rejected; and applying their scientific results by
   extrapolating back in time to identify the natural source of the color
   on an object and to determine the technology that produced that tint.
   The presentation will discuss some of the more important studies
   performed with my students in researching ancient organic colorants.
   Case histories of historically important archaeological dyes and
   pigments from plants, insects, and sea snail sources will be described.
   These include 2,000 year-old Roman Period textiles excavated at King
   Herod's palatial fortress at the mountain-top cliff of Masada in the
   Judean Desert of Israel, 3,000 year-old Phoenician purple pigments, and
   a 4,000 year-old Egyptian textile.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer foams have significant potential as contact traces for
   reconstructing the dynamics of felonies or for proving the presence of
   individuals at crime scenes. Discrimination of such items may be carried
   out using techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy or microscopy, which
   are commonly employed in the forensic examination of trace evidence.
   However, in the case of foams made of polyether urethane, the
   discriminating power attained by this approach is not satisfying. Time
   domain NMR (TD-NMR) allows the investigation of these materials in terms
   of total proton content (H\%), rigid phase fraction and mobility of the
   soft phase (solid echo T-2). Proton content and rigid fraction are
   partially correlated, in agreement with the chemistry of the material.
   The H\% and T-2 values are instead practically independent, and their
   simultaneous measurement allows discrimination of a specimen with high
   precision, comparable to TGA, without damaging the sample and using less
   than 50 mg of the material.}},

Abstract = {{The evidential significance of car seat fibres has been investigated.
   Thirty six samples of car seat fabric were examined and the fibres
   catalogued according to their morphology and characteristics. The
   majority of car seat fibres were black or grey thick polyester fibres
   that were either dyed or pigmented. The MSP spectra produced were unlike
   those usually obtained from black or grey polyester fibres used in
   clothing. Tapings taken from car seats were examined for car seat
   fibres, various types were found showing that these fibres are expected
   to shed from the fabric albeit in low numbers, unless the vehicle is
   older. No fibres that matched the samples of the car seat fabric were
   found on the tapings of the car seats. One hundred garments were
   examined for car seat fibres, 10\% of garments had populations of such
   fibres present and 41\% had at least one car seat fibre present. None of
   these fibres matched the samples of the car seat fabric or those from

   composed of adolescents and young adults (72.8\%). Easily available
   materials were used as ligature materials. Soft materials such as saree,
   shawl, lungie, and so on were used as ligature by 47\% of victims and
   hard materials such as coir rope, plastic rope, telephone cable, and so
   on were used by 29\% of victims. Oblique ligature mark was noted in
   94.2\% of cases. The ligature mark was noncontinuous in 78\% of cases.
   Horizontal ligature marks were noted in cases of partial hanging.
   Rupture of muscle fibers at the lower attachment of sternomastoid was
   seen in 19.6\%, and carotid intimal tear was seen in 1.1\% of cases.
   Fracture of hyoid bone at their greater horns was seen in 2.7\% and

Abstract = {{A minimally destructive technique for the determination of dyes in
   finished fibers provides an important tool for crime scene and other
   forensic investigations. The analytical power and the minimal sample
   consumption of time-of-flight-secondary ion mass spectrometric
   (TOF-SIMS) analysis provides the ability to obtain definitive molecular
   and elemental information relevant to fiber identification, including
   identification of dyes, from a very small volume of sample. For both
   fiber surface analysis and, with the aid of cryomicrotomy, fiber
   cross-section analysis, TOF-SIMS was used to identify various dyes in
   finished textile fibers. The analysis of C.I. Acid Blue 25 in nylon is
   presented as a representative example. The molecular ion of C.I. Acid
   Blue 25 with lower than 3\% on weight-of-fiber (owf) dye loading cannot
   be identified on dyed nylon surfaces by TOP-SIMS using a Bi-3(+) primary
   ion beam. Sputtering with C-60(+) provided the ability to remove surface
   contamination as well as at least partially remove Bi-induced damage,
   resulting in a greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio for the Acid Blue
   25 molecular ion. The use of C-60(+) for damage removal in a cyclic
   manner along with Bi for data acquisition provided the ability to
   unambiguously identify Acid Blue 25 via its molecular ion at a
   concentration of 0.1\% owf from both fiber surfaces and cross sections.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical capabilities to identify dyes associated with structurally
   robust wool fibers would critically assist crime-scene and
   explosion-scene forensics. Nondestructive separation of dyes from wool,
   removal of contaminants, and dye analysis by MALDI- or ESI-MS, were
   achieved in a single-pot, ionic liquid-based method. Ionic liquids (ILs)
   that readily denature the wool alpha-keratin structure have been
   identified and are conducive to small volume, high-throughput analysis
   for accelerated threat-response times. Wool dyed with commercial or
   natural, plant-based dyes have unique signatures that allow
   classification and matching of samples and identification of dyestuffs.
   Wool released 0.005 mg of dye per mg of dyed wool into the IL, allowing
   for analysis of single-thread sample sizes. The IL + dye mixture
   promotes sufficient ionization in MALDI-MS: addition of common MALDI
   matrices does not improve analysis of anionic wool dyes. An inexpensive,
   commercially available tetrabutylphosponium chloride IL was discovered
   to be capable of denaturing wool and was determined to be the most
   effective for this readily fieldable method.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac fibromas are benign conditions; however, their location and size
   may cause ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We report a

   detected a huge cardiac fibroma in the pars muscularis of the
   interventricular septum, occupying almost the entire muscular septum,
   and restricting the volume of left ventricular chamber. Histological
   examination revealed numerous foci of calcification in the alternating
   complex interlacing or strictly parallel collagenous fiber mass. Tumor
   mass was mainly demarcated, but in some places, fibrous infiltration of
   surrounding working cardiac muscle was found. We present a case when
   direct tumor involvement in the descending left bundle branches was
   evidenced. Mainly, the branches of septal fascicle were disrupted,
   entrapped, and degenerated by the tumor mass. This case report
   emphasizes that postmortem histological examination of conduction system
   in all sudden cardiac death cases may substantially improve the accuracy
   of postmortem diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{The current focal areas within forensic textile science are fibre
   identification and assessment of the method of damage to fabrics. This
   paper investigates fabric degradation within clandestine burials. The
   fabrics considered in this paper, unlike previous archaeological
   studies, are a modern polyester-cotton blend (65\%/35\%) and a 100\%
   cotton fabric both of which are commonly used for men's shirting fabrics
   in the UK. Three laundering conditions were investigated (i)
   not-laundered, (ii) laundered 6 times, and (iii) laundered 60 times;
   this represented varying conditions of fabric upon clothing deposition.
   The two burial conditions; sand and clay, were selected as extremes of
   soil type. The deposition times (15 and 30 days) were based on a study
   of clandestine burials in UK crimes. There were clear differences in how
   polyester-cotton and cotton stained within the two different soil
   conditions, polyester-cotton becoming extensively stained after a 30-day
   deposition in sand. The tear force required to tear the fabric after
   deposition, suggested that polyester/cotton fabrics were consistently
   weaker after burial, regardless of soil type and deposition period.
   There was also significant damage caused to not-laundered cotton fabrics
   after a 30-day deposition in clay. This work indicates that common
   apparel fabrics can degrade in relatively short times when buried. (C)

Abstract = {{A collaborative study on Raman spectroscopy and microspectrophotometry
   (MSP) was carried out by members of the ENFSI (European Network of
   Forensic Science Institutes) European Fibres Group (EFG) on different
   dyed cotton fabrics. The detection limits of the two methods were tested
   on two cotton sets with a dye concentration ranging from 0.5 to 0.005\%
   (w/w).
   This survey shows that it is possible to detect the presence of dye in
   fibres with concentrations below that detectable by the traditional
   methods of light microscopy and microspectrophotometry (MSP). The MSP
   detection limit for the dyes used in this study was found to be a
   concentration of 0.5\% (w/w). At this concentration, the fibres appear
   colourless with light microscopy. Raman spectroscopy clearly shows a
   higher potential to detect concentrations of dyes as low as 0.05\% for
   the yellow dye RY145 and 0.005\% for the blue dye RB221. This detection
   limit was found to depend both on the chemical composition of the dye
   itself and on the analytical conditions, particularly the laser
   wavelength.
   Furthermore, analysis of binary mixtures of dyes showed that while the
   minor dye was detected at 1.5\% (w/w) (30\% of the total dye
   concentration) using microspectrophotometry, it was detected at a level
   as low as 0.05\% (w/w) (10\% of the total dye concentration) using Raman
   spectroscopy.
   This work also highlights the importance of a flexible Raman instrument
   equipped with several lasers at different wavelengths for the analysis
   of dyed fibres. The operator and the set up of the analytical conditions
   are also of prime importance in order to obtain high quality spectra.
   Changing the laser wavelength is important to detect different dyes in a
   mixture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the analysis of shrunken heads referred to our forensic
   laboratory for anthropological expertise, and data from both
   anthropological and medical literature, we propose a complete forensic
   procedure for the analysis of such pieces.
   A list of 14 original morphological criteria has been developed, based
   on the global aspect, color, physical deformation, anatomical details,
   and eventual associated material (wood, vegetal fibers, sand, charcoals,
   etc.).
   Such criteria have been tested on a control sample of 20 tsantsa (i.e.
   shrunken heads from the Jivaro or Shuar tribes of South America).
   Further complementary analyses are described such as CT-scan and
   microscopic examination.
   Such expertise is more and more asked to forensic anthropologists and
   practitioners in a context of global repatriation of human artifacts to
   native communities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The question of whether chrysotile asbestos-containing brake
   dust can plausibly serve as a cause of mesothelioma in an exposed
   individual has become a matter of heated debate in the medical
   literature despite multiple international, federal, and state
   governmental agencies acknowledging a causal association.
   Objectives: We describe and provide an analysis of various industry and
   academic perspectives contributing to the debate.
   Methods: A framework is presented for evaluating the general and
   specific causal relationship between brake dust exposure and
   mesothelioma utilizing the principles of forensic epidemiology, and by
   applying the Bradford-Hill criteria.
   Results and conclusions: We conclude that there is a ``net{''} of
   evidence favoring a causal relationship between brake dust-associated
   chrysotile exposure and mesothelioma. The industry-sponsored position
   that there is insufficient evidence to support a contiguous ``chain{''}
   of causation is specious from both a methodologic and evidentiary
   perspective. Finally, we suggest a semiquantitative approach for the
   evaluation of individual causation in putative cases of mesothelioma
   with a history of significant brake dust exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The development of low-cost, accurate and sensitive diagnostic tests is
   crucial to many clinical, laboratory, and field applications, including
   forensics and medical diagnostics. Cellulose fiber-based paper is an
   inexpensive, biodegradable, and renewable resource, the use of which as
   a diagnostic device confers several advantages compared to traditional
   substrate. In this work, wax printer was used to produce collapsible
   microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs), which were
   combined with screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to create simple,
   low-cost, disposal devices in bulk. Herein, an electrochemical DNA
   sensor was introduced for the first time into a folding paper based on
   the AuNPs/graphene modified screen-printed working paper electrode
   (SPWPE). Thionine (TH) bound to double stranded DNA(dsDNA) as signal
   tags (TH/D1), together with Complementary ssDNA (S3) immobilized on
   Nanoporous gold (NPG) forming a S3-TH/D1-NPG bioconjugates. Owing to the
   chain structure of dsDNA and large specific surface area of NPG, the
   bioconjugates proved to be an excellent amplification label. Under
   optimal conditions, the folding mu PADs DNA sensor showed high
   sensitivity, good precision, acceptable stability, reproducibility and
   excellent performance in human serum assay. In addition, the simple,
   low-cost, sensitive device can be easily applied for point-of-care
   testing (POCT), public health and environmental monitoring in remote
   regions, developing or developed countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Qualitative analysis of complicated paint samples from traffic accident
   cases can usually be dealt with by Fourier Transform Infrared
   Spectroscopy (FTIR) or Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
   (Py-GC/MS); however, the collection of quantitative evidence is still
   difficult, especially for solid and cured polymers, due to multiple
   factors involved. Polystyrene, one of the commonly used ingredients in
   paint recipes, is quantified by pyrolysis-GC/MS which offers
   satisfactory performance with low sample consumption and high
   sensitivity. Not only are the characteristics of PS during the various
   pyrolyzing process discussed, but also the matrix effects on
   quantification are evaluated for better identification of paint sources.
   We design a method based on the unique pyrolysis characteristics of
   polystyrene, in which styrene is the major pyrolysis product at nearly
   750 degrees C, to identify and quantify paint samples of different
   sources with limited quantities and high similarities. Validation of
   this method is accomplished by joining international proficiency tests
   twice successfully meeting the requirements, indicating that the method
   is useful and feasible in examining vehicle paint traces with the
   convenience and practicability of combining with other analytical

Abstract = {{In Europe, authorities frequently ask forensic laboratories to analyze
   seized cannabis plants to prove that cultivation was illegal (drug type
   and not fiber type). This is generally done with mature and flowering
   plants. However, authorities are often confronted with very young
   specimens. The aim of our study was to evaluate when the chemotype of
   cannabis plantlets can be surely determined through analysis of eight
   major cannabinoids content during growth. Drug-type seedlings and
   cuttings were cultivated, sampled each week, and analyzed by
   high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The
   chemotype of clones was recognizable at any developmental stage because
   of high total ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations even at the
   start of the cultivation. Conversely, right after germination seedlings
   contained a low total THC content, but it increased quickly with plant
   age up, allowing chemotype determination after 3 weeks. In conclusion,
   it is not necessary to wait for plants flowering to identify drug-type
   cannabis generally cultivated in Europe.}},

Title = {{Novel method for determining DDT in vapour and particulate phases within

Abstract = {{The organochlorine insecticide DDT
   (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) is still used for
   malaria vector control in certain areas of South Africa. The strict
   Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS) allows
   spraying on the inside of traditional dwellings with DDT. In rural
   villages contaminated dust presents an additional pathway for exposure
   to DDT. We present a new method for the determination of DDT in indoor
   air where separate vapour and particulate samples are collected in a
   single step with a denuder configuration of a multi-channel open tubular
   silicone rubber (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) trap combined with a micro
   quartz fibre filter. The multi-channel PDMS trap section of the denuder
   concentrates vapour phase insecticide whereas particle associated
   insecticide is transferred downstream where it is collected on a
   micro-fibre filter followed by a second multi-channel PDMS trap to
   capture the blow-off from the filter. The multi-channel PDMS trap and
   filter combination are designed to fit a commercial thermal desorber for
   direct introduction of samples into a GC-MS. The technique is
   solvent-free. Analyte extraction and sample clean-up is not required.
   Two fractions, vapour phase and particulate phase p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT:
   p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDD; p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDE in 4L contaminated indoor air,
   were each quantitatively analysed by GC-MS using isotopically labelled
   ring substituted C-13(12) - p,p'-DDT as an internal standard. Limits of
   detection were 0.07-0.35 ng m(-3) for p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD,
   o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDE. Ratios of airborne p,p'-DDD/p,p'-DDT
   and of o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT are unusual and do not match the ideal
   certified ingredient composition required of commercial DDT. Results
   suggest that the DDT products used for indoor residual spraying (IRS)
   prior to, and during 2007, may have been compromised with regards to
   insecticidal efficacy, demonstrating the power of this new environmental
   forensics tool. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we wanted to investigate whether or not the
   tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) synthase gene, which codes for the
   enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of THCA, influences the production
   and storage of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a dose-dependent manner.
   THCA is actually decarboxylated to produce THC, the main psychoactive
   component in the Cannabis plant.
   Assuming as the research hypothesis a correlation between the gene copy
   number and the production of THC, gene quantification could be useful in
   forensics in order to complement or replace chemical analysis for the
   identification and classification of seized Cannabis samples, thus
   distinguishing the drug-type from the fibre-type varieties.
   A real-time PCR assay for the relative quantification of the THCA
   synthase gene was then validated on Cannabis samples; some were seized
   from the illegal drug market and others were derived from experimental
   cultivation. In order to determine the gene copy number to compare high
   vs. low potency plants, we chose the Delta Delta Ct method for TaqMan
   reactions. The assay enabled single plants with zero, one, and two
   copies of the gene to be distinguished.
   As a result of this first part of the research on the THCA synthase gene
   (the second part will cover a study of gene expression), we found no
   correlation between THCA synthase gene copy number and the content of
   THC in the herbal Cannabis samples tested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{For the first time, electromembrane extraction (EME) of six basic drugs
   of abuse from undiluted whole blood and post mortem blood in a totally
   stagnant system is reported. Cathinone, methamphetamine,
   3,4-methylenedioxy-amphetamine (MDA),
   3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphet-amine (MDMA), ketamine and
   2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) were extracted from the whole
   blood sample, through a supported liquid membrane (SLM) consisting of
   1-ethyl-2-nitrobenzene (ENB) immobilized in the pores of a hollow fiber,
   and into an aqueous acceptor solution inside the lumen of the hollow
   fiber. The SLM acts as a barrier with efficient exclusion of all
   macromolecules and acidic substances in the sample. Due to the
   application of the electrical field, only the cationic compounds of
   interest are extracted efficiently across the membrane, thus providing
   extremely clean extracts for analysis with liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry, LC-MS. Recoveries in the range 10-30\% were obtained from
   80111 whole blood within 5 min extraction time and an applied voltage of
   15 V across the SLM. The optimized technique was tested on real forensic
   whole blood samples taken from three forensic autopsy cases and on five
   forensic whole blood samples from living persons. The results were in
   agreement with the analysis using standard sample preparation methods
   (liquid-liquid extraction) performed on the same samples by Norwegian
   Institute of Public Health (NIPH), Division of Forensic Toxicology and
   Drug Abuse Research. Evaluation data were acceptable, with limit of
   detections (LODs) in the range 40-2610 pg/mL, well below concentrations
   associated with drug abuse: linearites in the range between 10 and 250
   ng/mL with r(2) values above 0.9939, and with repeatability (RSD) of
   7-32\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of low-cost, accurate, and equipment-free diagnostic
   tests is crucial to many clinical, laboratory, and field applications,
   including forensics and medical diagnostics. Cellulose fiber-based paper
   is an inexpensive, biodegradable, and renewable resource, the use of
   which as a biomolecule detection matrix and support confers several
   advantages compared to traditional materials such as glass. In this
   context, a new, facile method for the preparation of surface
   functionalized papers bearing single-stranded probe DNA (ssDNA) for
   rapid target hybridization via capillary transport is presented.
   Optimized reaction conditions were developed that allowed the direct,
   one-step activation of standard laboratory filters by the inexpensive
   and readily available bifunctional linking reagent,
   1,4-phenylenediisothiocyanate. Such papers were thus amenable to
   subsequent coupling of amine-labeled ssDNA under standard conditions
   widely used for glass-based supports. The intrinsic wicking ability of
   the paper matrix facilitated rapid sample elution through arrays of
   probe DNA, leading to significant, detectable hybridization in the time
   required for the sample liquid to transit the vertical length of the
   strip (less than 2 min). The broad applicability of these paper test
   strips as rapid and specific diagnostics in ``real-life{''} situations
   was exemplified by the discrimination of amplicons generated from canine
   and human mitochondrial and genomic DNA in mock forensic samples.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-Raman and micro-FTIR spectroscopy were used to investigate raw and
   dyed polyacrylonitril (PAN) fibers with three different linear densities
   (3,6 and 9 den), dyed with three cationic dyes (red, blue and yellow) by
   standard procedure. The Raman and the ER spectra of the raw and dyed
   fibers as well as the corresponding spectra of pure dyes were analyzed.
   High quality spectra, both Raman and IR were obtained, requiring no
   sample preparation. Dyed fibers gave Raman spectra with bands
   characteristic for both the polymer and the dyes, while the IR spectra
   consist of predominantly bands due to the fiber polymer. Spectral
   subtraction procedures were used to separate the Raman spectra of the
   raw PAN fiber from the corresponding spectrum of dyed fiber and were
   then compared with the Raman spectra of pure dyes. The recorded Raman
   spectra of the three different linear densities of dyed fibers did not
   show variation in band frequencies, but in one dyed (blue) fiber, a
   regular variation in the band intensities was observed. This effect has
   been related to the quantity of the dye fixed on the (blue) fiber in
   three different linear densities. The results were compared with the
   quantity of the absorbed dye, previously determined for the blue fiber
   by colorimetric measurements. (doi: 10.5562/cca1888)}},

Abstract = {{The application of diffuse reflectance UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy is
   proposed to differentiate 20 office paper samples, which had been deemed
   similar by a preliminary visual examination under several different
   lighting sources. The samples were firstly screened on the basis of the
   qualitative appearance of their spectra. A further discrimination was
   obtained by taking into account three parameters: the average
   reflectivity of the paper samples in the range 680-900 nm, and the
   integrated intensity of the absorption peak in the UV range at 272 nm
   and at 360 nm. The homogeneity of these parameters on both sides of the
   paper sheets was assessed, detecting a very uniform distribution of the
   optical brighteners. A special focus was posed on the determination of
   the discriminative power, in order to give a quantitative parameter on
   the proposed procedure, which is important when reporting results to the
   Court. The remarkable achievement of differentiating all the examined
   samples was obtained by UV-VIS spectroscopy, a very less expensive
   technique which is readily available in practically all forensic
   laboratories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The application of social network theory to understanding the nature and

   to be a useful means of identifying the prevalence of such transfers.
   Four experimental scenarios of increasing complexity empirically
   demonstrate that this trace particulate evidence exhibits behaviour in
   accordance with that previously identified for hair and fibre evidence.
   However, the utilisation of social network concepts is demonstrated to
   add valuable insights into the behaviour of this form of evidence and is
   shown to be a useful tool in highlighting the complexity of evidence
   dynamics. The identification of the networks within which trace evidence
   is transferred has implications for the robust interpretation of
   particulate evidence during the process of crime reconstruction. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, 23 years old human blood stains on different and
   problematic carrier materials, such as jeans, leather, wood, wallpaper,
   carpet, wool, and nylon fabric, were investigated by mRNA analysis of
   the blood markers HBB and SPTB. HBB turned out to be a very stable
   marker that could be detected in all blood samples from all carrier
   materials whereas SPTB showed no positive result in any of these old
   samples. Typing of co-extracted genomic DNA provided full STR profiles
   with the exception of one stain resulting in a partial profile. No
   differences were observed regarding the quality of results due to
   possible inhibitorial substances from carrier materials such as jeans or
   leather, whereas some difficulties to extract nucleic acids were caused
   by the physical properties of materials such as carpet fibres. HBB can
   be highly recommended for the identification of old blood stains in
   forensic casework as it was possible to detect HBB even in stains that
   failed to provide a full DNA profile. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Venlafaxine is a phenethylamine derivative widely prescribed for the
   treatment of depression which inhibits both serotonin and norepinephrine
   reuptake (SNRI). In treatment with antidepressants of patient with
   depression and other psychiatric disorders there is also increased risk
   of suicidal thought and behaviour. Several lethal intoxications
   involving venlafaxine usually among psychotic patients have been
   reported in the literature. Sample preparation is of the greatest
   significance for a successful toxicological analysis. The development of
   simple, effective and rapid extraction procedures of drugs from
   post-mortem biological samples is a challenge. Headspace-solid phase
   microextraction (HS-SPME) offers significant advantages such as
   simplicity, low cost, compatibility with analytical systems, automation
   and solvent-free extraction. The aim of our work was the optimization of
   a HS-SPME procedure for the determination of venlafaxine in post-mortem
   biological samples by gas chromatography (GC) with nitrogen-phosphorous
   detection (NPD). Venlafaxine was extracted on 100 mm
   Polydimethylsiloxone Coating-Red (PDMS) SPME fiber and determined by
   GC-NPD. Salt addition, extraction temperature, preheating and extraction
   time were optimized to enhance the recovery of the extraction from
   aqueous solution spiked with venlafaxine.
   Finally the developed procedure was applied to post-mortem biological
   samples of a fatally poisoned woman by venlafaxine. The drug was
   quantified in post-mortem blood gastric and oesophagus contents of the
   deceased woman.
   A simple and rapid procedure using HS-SPME was developed for sample
   preparation of venlafaxine in post-mortem biological samples prior to
   GC-NPD determination. Validation data was satisfactory, thus enabling
   application in the toxicological analysis of forensic samples. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The determination of trace amounts of oil in water facilitates the
   forensic analysis on the presence and origin of oil in the aqueous
   environment. To this end, the present study focuses on direct sensing
   schemes for quantifying trace amounts of oil in water using mid-infrared
   (MIR) evanescent field absorption spectroscopy via fiberoptic chemical
   sensors. MIR transparent silver halide fibers were utilized as optical
   transducer for interrogating oil-in-water emulsions via the evanescent
   field emanating from the waveguide surface, and penetrating the
   surrounding aqueous environment by a couple of micrometers. Unmodified
   fibers and fibers surface-modified with grafted epoxidized polybutadiene
   layers enabled the direct detection of crude oil in a deionized water
   matrix at the ppm level to ppb concentration level, respectively. Thus,
   direct chemical sensing of crude oil IR signatures without any sample
   preparation as low as 46 ppb was achieved with a response time of a few
   seconds.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic light sources (FLS) have been used frequently in crime scene
   investigation as a scanning tool for crime scene evidence, such as
   gunpowder residue, semen, bloodstain, saliva and urine. There were
   several FLS reported in literature, such as Polilight r, Lumatec
   Superlite 400, PolirayTM, Bluemaxx BM500 and high intensity LED.
   LED-based light sources are low in cost and flexible in design.
   Moreover, LED technologies have been well developed recently, where
   several types of wavelength LED can be used for light source design.
   From literature, near-UV light (300-400nm) and blue (450nm) light are
   useful for detecting semen, urine and saliva stains, while 415nm light
   is useful for bloodstains detection. In this paper, a simple, low cost
   and portable LED-based multi-wavelength light source for forensic
   application is proposed. The proposed multi-wavelength light source is
   able to supply near-UV, blue and 415nm lights from the same point of
   source and direction, without utilizing any light guide, such as optical
   fiber. Each type of LED array was mounted separately on the different
   surfaces of a holder. DC motor was used to rotate the holder for
   directing the selected LED array to face the object. The proposed design
   is low in cost, easy to be manufactured, user-friendly and comparable to
   the other expensive FLS, such as Polilight r PL500 and Crime-lite r 2,
   in terms of detectable dilution of bloodstains.}},

Abstract = {{A major component of trace evidence in crime investigations is generated
   from fibers. Current standard practice for comparing fibers in cases
   involves analysis by optical microscopy, microspectrophotometry (visible
   and infrared), and thin layer chromatography. Chromatographic analysis
   was expanded to high performance liquid chromatography with detection by
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Data from reverse phase analysis of
   selected acid dyes for residential and commercial carpet and disperse
   dyes used in automotive fabrics will be presented. Very small weights of
   fibers were analyzed: Liquid chromatography separated the dye components
   and mass spectrometry data gave exact mass, making sample comparisons
   nearly unambiguous. The development of optimized liquid
   chromatography/mass spectrometry methods and incorporation of the
   results into a searchable database may provide an improvement in trace
   evidence analysis involving dyed fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The gluteal region is usually the preferred site for
   intramuscular injections. However, reported complications include pain,
   abscess formation, hematoma formation and peripheral nerve injury, most
   frequently sciatic nerve injury. Here, we aimed to analyze the
   demographical, clinical and electrophysiological features of patients
   with sciatic nerve injury following gluteal intramuscular injections and
   to summarize the legal procedure in Turkey.
   Methods: We retrospectively investigated the clinical and
   electrophysiological features of 33 patients who were admitted to our
   electrophysiology department between January 1995 and June 2006 with
   symptoms and signs of sciatic nerve injury which appeared after
   intramuscular injection in the gluteal region and we reviewed the legal
   procedure.
   Results: There were 16 male (48.5\%) and 17 female (51.5\%) patients.
   Age range was between 1.5 and 81 years. The interval between nerve
   injury and admission to our laboratory ranged from 20 days to 25 years.
   24 patients were admitted within 6 months after the injury, 32, within 1
   year and, only one was admitted after 25 years. The patients who were
   admitted within the first 6 months after the injury, were commonly
   admitted for diagnosis and determination of prognosis, whereas the
   patients in the late periods were referred as a part of medico-legal
   procedure. All patients expressed burning and shock-like pain radiating
   to the whole lower extremity. The other symptoms were weakness (50\%),
   numbness (9.1\%), and paresthesia (4.5\%). Electrophysiologically, both
   divisions of the sciatic nerve were affected in 9 (27.2\%) and axonal
   involvement of the lateral division predominated in the remaining
   patients.
   Conclusion: Injection neuropathy constitutes the major part of the
   sciatic nerve injuries. Most frequent symptoms are burning pain and
   weakness. In any traumatic sciatic neuropathy, the peroneal nerve seems
   to be involved more frequently resulting from the more lateral and
   superficial location of the fibers supplying the peroneal nerve. Axonal
   involvement is generally predominating in injection neuropathies.
   Patients even in the late period are referred to the electrophysiology
   laboratory for determination of sequela and medico-legal procedures. All
   medical staff should be aware of clinical and electrophysiological
   findings and medicolegal approach in this condition. (Archives of
   Neuropsychiatry 2012; 49: 208-211)}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the amount of digitally captured traces at crime scenes
   increased rapidly. There are various kinds of such traces, like pick
   marks on locks, latent fingerprints on various surfaces as well as
   different micro traces. Those traces are different from each other not
   only in kind but also in which information they provide. Every kind of
   trace has its own properties (e. g., minutiae for fingerprints, or
   raking traces for locks) but there are also large amounts of metadata
   which all traces have in common like location, time and other additional
   information in relation to crime scenes. For selected types of crime
   scene traces, type-specific databases already exist, such as the ViCLAS
   for sexual offences, the IBIS for ballistic forensics or the AFIS for
   fingerprints. These existing forensic databases strongly differ in the
   trace description models.
   For forensic experts it would be beneficial to work with only one
   database capable of handling all possible forensic traces acquired at a
   crime scene. This is especially the case when different kinds of traces
   are interrelated (e. g., fingerprints and ballistic marks on a bullet
   casing). Unfortunately, current research on interrelated traces as well
   as general forensic data models and structures is not mature enough to
   build such an encompassing forensic database. Nevertheless, recent
   advances in the field of contact-less scanning make it possible to
   acquire different kinds of traces with the same device. Therefore the
   data of these traces is structured similarly what simplifies the design
   of a general forensic data model for different kinds of traces.
   In this paper we introduce a first common description model for
   different forensic trace types. Furthermore, we apply for selected trace
   types from the well established database schema development process the
   phases of transferring expert knowledge in the corresponding forensic
   fields into an extendible, database-driven, generalised forensic
   description model. The trace types considered here are fingerprint
   traces, traces at locks, micro traces and ballistic traces. Based on
   these basic trace types, also combined traces (multiple or overlapped
   fingerprints, fingerprints on bullet casings, etc) and partial traces
   are considered.}},

Abstract = {{The forensic analysis of fibers is currently completely manual and
   therefore time consuming. The automation of analysis steps can
   significantly support forensic experts and reduce the time, required for
   the investigation. Moreover, a subjective expert belief is extended by
   objective machine estimation. This work proposes the pattern recognition
   pipeline containing the digital acquisition of a fiber media, the
   pre-processing for fiber segmentation, and the extraction of the
   distinctive characteristics of fibers. Currently, basic geometrical
   features like width, height, area of optically dominant fibers are
   investigated. In order to support the automatic classification of
   fibers, supervised machine learning algorithms are evaluated. The
   experimental setup includes a car seat and two pieces clothing of a
   different fabric. As preliminary work, acrylic as synthetic and sheep
   wool as natural fiber are chosen to be classified. While sitting on the
   seat, a test person leaves textile fibers. The test aims at automatic
   distinguishing of clothes through the fiber traces gained from the seat
   with the help of adhesive tape. The digitalization of fiber samples is
   provided by a contactless chromatic white light sensor. First test
   results showed, that two optically very different fibers can be properly
   assigned to their corresponding fiber type. The best classifier achieves
   an accuracy of 75 percent correctly classified samples for our suggested
   features.}},

Abstract = {{The following paper aims to illustrate certain investigative activities
   in the forensic analysis and examination of the scene of traffic
   accidents. When a traffic accident occurs, the scene must be secured as
   soon as possible to enable professional and proper forensic
   investigation. Failure to secure the accident scene might result in
   losing or contaminating the traces, which makes it more difficult to
   prove or explain trace evidence in further procedure or even makes such
   evidence inadmissible. The topic is discussed from the viewpoint of
   crime scene examination, since analysing and investigating traffic
   accidents requires a great deal of expertise and attention of the
   investigators. Complex traffic accidents include feigned accidents,
   hit-and-run accidents as well as accidents in which the driver and
   passengers, dead or alive, need to be identified. In identifying the
   passengers, standard criminal investigation methods as well as police
   forensic and forensic medicine methods are followed. Such methods
   include confirming the identities with identity documents, other
   documents and vehicle ownership, fingerprints, biological traces, fibre
   traces, contact traces, traces of physical injuries on the driver and
   passengers, etc. According to the results obtained in fingerprint
   detection on human skin surfaces, this method can also be applied in
   confirming physical contact between the driver and the passengers in the
   accident, e.g. in the event of moving the victims and changing the scene
   of the accident.}},

Title = {{Rapid and on-site analysis of illegal drugs on the nano-microscale using

Abstract = {{A deep ultraviolet-visible (DUV-Vis) reflected optical fiber sensor was
   developed for use in a simple spectrophotometric detection system to
   detect the absorption of various illegal drugs at wavelengths between
   180 and 800 nm. Quantitative analyses performed using the sensor
   revealed a high specificity and sensitivity for drug detection at a
   wavelength of approximately 200 nm. Using a double-absorption optical
   path length, extremely small sample volumes were used (32 to 160 nL),
   which allowed the use of minimal amounts of samples. A portable
   spectrophotometric system was established based on our optical fiber
   sensor for the on-site determination and quantitative analysis of common
   illegal drugs, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA),
   ketamine hydrochloride, cocaine hydrochloride, diazepam, phenobarbital,
   and barbital. By analyzing the absorbance spectra, six different drugs
   were quantified at concentrations that ranged from 0.1 to 1000 mu g
   mL(-1) (16 pg-0.16 mu g). A novel Matching Algorithm of Spectra Space
   (MASS) was used to accurately distinguish between each drug in a
   mixture. As an important supplement to traditional methods, such as mass
   spectrometry or chromatography, our optical fiber sensor offers rapid
   and low-cost on-site detection using trace amounts of sample. This rapid
   and accurate analytical method has wide-ranging applications in forensic
   science, law enforcement, and medicine.}},

Abstract = {{During the forensic examination of textile fibers, fibers are usually
   mounted on glass slides for visual inspection and identification under
   the microscope. One method that has the capability to accurately
   identify single textile fibers without subsequent demounting is Raman
   microspectroscopy. The effect of the mountant Entellan New on the Raman
   spectra of fibers was investigated to determine if it is suitable for
   fiber analysis. Raman spectra of synthetic fibers mounted in three
   different ways were collected and subjected to multivariate analysis.
   Principal component analysis score plots revealed that while spectra
   from different fiber classes formed distinct groups, fibers of the same
   class formed a single group regardless of the mounting method. The
   spectra of bare fibers and those mounted in Entellan New were found to
   be statistically indistinguishable by analysis of variance calculations.
   These results demonstrate that fibers mounted in Entellan New may be
   identified directly by Raman microspectroscopy without further sample
   preparation.}},

Abstract = {{This study takes the first step toward in situ analysis of powder drugs
   which does not require any alteration of the samples. A fast,
   inexpensive analytical method based on reflectance near-infrared (NIR)
   spectrometry and multivariate calibration was applied. A diode-array
   fiber-optic portable spectrometer in the 9001700 nm range was employed.
   Samples were laboratory-prepared ternary powders (diacetylmorphine,
   caffeine, and paracetamol). Partial least squares regression was
   applied. The choice of the standard samples for calibration and
   validation was performed through a D-optimal experimental design. The
   explained variance was higher than 90\%, and the relative root mean
   square errors were <2\%. The number of principal components (6) was very
   low when compared with the number of raw variables (356 absorbance
   values). Response plots showed slopes and intercepts were very close to
   optimal values. Correlation coefficients ranged between 0.909 and 0.989.
   The method here proposed proved to be competitive with Fourier transform
   NIR spectrometry.}},

Title = {{In situ labeling of DNA reveals interindividual variation in nuclear DNA
   breakdown in hair and may be useful to predict success of forensic

Abstract = {{Hair fibers are formed by keratinocytes of the hair follicle in a
   process that involves the breakdown of the nucleus including DNA.
   Accordingly, DNA can be isolated with high yield from the hair bulb
   which contains living keratinocytes, whereas it is difficult to prepare
   from the distal portions of hair fibers and from shed hair.
   Nevertheless, forensic investigations are successful in a fraction of
   shed hair samples found at crime scenes. Here, we report that
   interindividual differences in the completeness of DNA removal from hair
   corneocytes are major determinants of DNA content and success rates of
   forensic investigations of hair. Distal hair samples were permeabilized
   with ammonia and incubated with the DNA-specific dye Hoechst 33258 to
   label DNA in situ. Residual nuclear DNA was visualized under the
   fluorescence microscope. Hair from some donors did not contain any
   stainable nuclei, whereas hair of other donors contained a variable
   number of DNA-positive nuclear remnants. The number of DNA-containing
   nuclear remnants per millimeter of hair correlated with the amount of
   DNA that could be extracted and amplified by quantitative PCR. When
   individual hairs were investigated, only hairs in which DNA could be
   labeled in situ gave positive results in short tandem repeat typing.
   This study reveals that the completeness of DNA degradation during
   cornification of the hair is a polymorphic trait. Furthermore, our
   results suggest that in situ labeling of DNA in hair may be useful for
   predicting the probability of success of forensic analysis of nuclear
   DNA in shed hair.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of skin are important for a number of
   applications including surgery, dermatology, impact biomechanics and
   forensic science. In this study, we have investigated the influence of
   location and orientation on the deformation characteristics of 56
   samples of excised human skin. Uniaxial tensile tests were carried out
   at a strain rate of 0.012 s(-1) on skin from the back. Digital Image
   Correlation was used for 2D strain measurement and a histological
   examination of the dermis was also performed. The mean ultimate tensile
   strength (UTS) was 21.6 +/- 8.4 MPa, the mean failure strain 54\% +/-
   17\%, the mean initial slope 1.18 +/- 0.88 MPa, the mean elastic modulus
   83.3 +/- 34.9 MPa and the mean strain energy was 3.6 +/- 1.6 MJ/m(3). A
   multivariate analysis of variance has shown that these mechanical
   properties of skin are dependent upon the orientation of the Langer
   lines (P < 0.0001 - P = 0.046). The location of specimens on the back
   was also found to have a significant effect on the UTS (P = 0.0002), the
   elastic modulus (P = 0.001) and the strain energy (P = 0.0052). The
   histological investigation concluded that there is a definite
   correlation between the orientation of the Langer lines and the
   preferred orientation of collagen fibres in the dermis (P < 0.001). The
   data obtained in this study will provide essential information for those
   wishing to model the skin using a structural constitutive model. (C)

Abstract = {{In a double murder investigation, the victims were found after a
   prolonged stay in a drainage canal. In spite of the expectations, fibre
   examination established a multitude of primary and secondary transferred
   fibres. One of these fibre types was a colourless polyester fibre
   possessing a blue coloured molten fibre end. These matched one of the
   types present in the suspect's blue denim trousers. The aim of this
   study was to verify the rarity of this peculiar fibre type and more
   precisely its presence in blue denim textiles. Over five hundred
   different blue jeans textiles were examined and only one of these
   presented exactly the same type. The comparison involved microscopy,
   microspectrophotometry in the visible range and Raman spectroscopy. The
   results indicate this fibre type is extremely rare in a blue jeans
   fabrics and that ``standard{''} blue denim should not be disregarded in
   case work. (C) 2011 Forensic Science Society. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Textile fibres were transferred to a pig skin carcass and their
   persistence determined at daily intervals for up to a 12 day period
   during which time the carcass was left outdoors exposed to the
   prevailing weather conditions and animal activity. In the absence of
   strong winds and precipitation, the loss of fibres was found to be
   exponential. Stronger winds and heavier precipitation caused an increase
   in the rate of loss of fibres. The results of this study showed that the
   majority of fibres transferred to a body deposited outdoors, can be
   expected to be lost after the first 2 days, however, none of the
   experiments performed resulted in a complete loss of fibres, even after
   12 days exposure. These persistence characteristics differed from those
   observed in a similar study using small sections of skin, rather than
   carcasses.
   The implications of the results of the present study in relation to the
   examination of fibre evidence in cases of homicide are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{The main aim of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive and
   critical verification of methodology commonly used for sample
   collection, storage and preparation in studies concerning the analysis
   of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in aqueous environmental samples
   with the usage of SPE-LC/MS techniques. This manuscript reports the
   results of investigations into several sample preparation parameters
   that to the authors' knowledge have not been reported or have received
   very little attention. This includes: (i) effect of evaporation
   temperature and (ii) solvent with regards to solid phase extraction
   (SPE) extracts; (iii) effect of silanising glassware; (iv) recovery of
   analytes during vacuum filtration through glass fibre filters and (v)
   pre LC-MS filter membranes. All of these parameters are vital to develop
   efficient and reliable extraction techniques; an essential factor given
   that target drug residues are often present in the aqueous environment
   at ng L-1 levels. Presented is also the first comprehensive review of
   the stability of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Among
   the parameters studied are: time of storage, temperature and pH. Over 60
   analytes were targeted including stimulants, opioid and morphine
   derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, dissociative
   anaesthetics, drug precursors, human urine indicators and their
   metabolites. The lack of stability of analytes in raw wastewater was
   found to be significant for many compounds. For instance, 34\% of
   compounds studied reported a stability change >15\% after only 12 h in
   raw wastewater stored at 2 degrees C; a very important finding given
   that wastewater is typically collected with the use of 24 h composite
   samplers. The stability of these compounds is also critical given the
   recent development of so-called `sewage forensics' or `sewage
   epidemiology' in which concentrations of target drug residues in
   wastewater are used to back-calculate drug consumption. Without an
   understanding of stability, under (or over) reporting of consumption
   estimations may take place. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic impurity profiling of seized 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
   (MDMA) tablets aims to link tablets to common production sources.
   Conventionally, organic impurities are extracted from tablets using a
   liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) procedure prior to analysis by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In this research, the
   development of an alternative microwave-assisted extraction/headspace
   solid-phase microextraction (MAE/HS-SPME) procedure is described. The
   optimal procedure used phosphate buffer (1 M, pH 8), with an HS-SPME
   extraction temperature of 70 degrees C for 40 min, using a
   divinylbenzene/Carboxen (TM)/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber.
   Impurities were extracted from seized MDMA exhibits using the
   MAE/HS-SPME procedure, as well as HS-SPME alone, and a conventional LLE
   procedure. The HS-SPME procedure was deemed to be the most practical
   because of the affordability and need for less analyst involvement.
   Although the LLE was limited in the number of impurities extracted, the
   procedure is still useful for the extraction of less volatile impurities
   that are not extracted by HS-SPME.}},

Abstract = {{Plastic debris < 1 mm (defined here as microplastic) is accumulating in
   marine habitats. Ingestion of microplastic provides a potential pathway
   for the transfer of pollutants, monomers, and plastic-additives to
   organisms with uncertain consequences for their health. Here, we show
   that microplastic contaminates the shorelines at 18 sites worldwide
   representing six continents from the poles to the equator, with more
   material in densely populated areas, but no clear relationship between
   the abundance of miocroplastics and the mean size-distribution of
   natural particulates. An important source of microplastic appears to be
   through sewage contaminated by fibers from washing clothes. Forensic
   evaluation of microplastic from sediments showed that the proportions of
   polyester and acrylic fibers used in clothing resembled those found in
   habitats that receive sewage-discharges and sewage-effluent itself.
   Experiments sampling wastewater from domestic washing machines
   demonstrated that a single garment can produce > 1900 fibers per wash.
   This suggests that a large proportion of microplastic fibers found in
   the marine environment may be derived from sewage as a consequence of
   washing of clothes. As the human population grows and people use more
   synthetic textiles, contamination of habitats and animals by
   microplastic is likely to increase.}},

   trapped between the fibres of highly fluorescent textile specimens. The
   total acquisition time of the spectra of the drug particles was 90s

   (PTFE) of 120 pg (surface concentration 0.07 ng mm(-2)) and 50 pg
   (surface concentration 0.03 ng mm(-2)), were achieved for sodium
   chlorate and sodium perchlorate, respectively. The compounds of interest
   were examined in the presence of a hydrocarbon mixture to assess matrix
   effects: only a two- or three-fold decrease in the target ion intensity
   was observed. Commercial fireworks were analyzed to determine
   perchlorate salts in complex mixtures. This work demonstrates the
   potential applicability of ambient ionization mass spectrometry to
   forensic investigations involving improvised explosives.}},

Abstract = {{A range of protein stains were utilised for the enhancement of footwear
   impressions on a variety of fabric types of different colours with blood

   reagent to determine the repeatability of the enhancement. Results
   indicated that while most protein stains used in this study successfully
   enhanced impressions in blood on light coloured fabrics, background
   staining caused interference on natural fabrics. Enhancement on dark
   coloured fabrics was only achieved using fluorescent protein stains, as
   non-fluorescent protein stains provided poor contrast. A further
   comparison was performed with commercially available protein staining
   solutions and solutions prepared within the laboratory from the
   appropriate chemicals. Both solutions performed equally well, though it
   is recommended to use freshly prepared solutions whenever possible. (C)

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{210}},
Number = {{1-3}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Improvised explosive devices (IED) are responsible for a significant
   proportion of combat and civilian deaths around the world. Given the
   ease with which IEDs can be made, the large quantity of explosive which
   can be contained within or on a vehicle, and the use of VBIED in the
   past (for example the 2002 Bali bombing) in terrorist activities, VBIED
   are an ongoing concern for Defence and law enforcement agencies.
   Fingermark and DNA analyses are routinely used by police and forensic
   analysts to identify suspects involved in illegal activities. There is
   limited information available on the feasibility of obtaining
   fingermarks, fibres, hair and DNA samples following an explosive
   incident, or a situation whereby an IED has been rendered safe following
   the utilisation of an appropriate defeat or render-safe tool.
   The main objective of this study was to determine if fingermarks and/or
   DNA (from saliva and hair samples) placed on the interior and exterior
   of road vehicles, and on inanimate objects (such as plastic or glass
   bottles), are able to be obtained and analysed following the use of a
   vehicle-borne IED (VBIED) render-safe tool on a vehicle containing
   simulated explosives.
   The identification of fingermarks on the exterior (67.2 +/- 8.5\%) and
   interior (43.8 +/- 17.8\%) of the vehicles was possible following the
   use of the render-safe tool, though this was more challenging in the
   latter than the former. Fingermarks were also able to be identified from
   both plastic and glass bottles placed inside the vehicles. Polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) techniques yielded DNA profiles that were able to
   be identified from saliva and hair samples. These preliminary results
   suggest that both fingermarks and DNA profiles, obtained from vehicles
   that have been subjected to a VBIED render-safe tool, may be used to
   identify persons of interest. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{107}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an experimental study about the classification
   ability of several classifiers for multi-class classification of
   cannabis seedlings. As the cultivation of drug type cannabis is
   forbidden in Switzerland law enforcement authorities regularly ask
   forensic laboratories to determinate the chemotype of a seized cannabis
   plant and then to conclude if the plantation is legal or not. This
   classification is mainly performed when the plant is mature as required
   by the EU official protocol and then the classification of cannabis
   seedlings is a time consuming and costly procedure. A previous study
   made by the authors has investigated this problematic Ill and showed
   that it is possible to differentiate between drug type (illegal) and
   fibre type (legal) cannabis at an early stage of growth using gas
   chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry (GC MS) based on the
   relative proportions of eight major leaf compounds. The aims of the
   present work are on one hand to continue former work and to optimize the
   methodology for the discrimination of drug- and fibre type cannabis
   developed in the previous study and on the other hand to investigate the
   possibility to predict illegal cannabis varieties. Seven classifiers for
   differentiating between cannabis seedlings are evaluated in this paper,
   namely Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Partial Least Squares
   Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Nearest Neighbour Classification (NNC),
   Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Radial Basis Function Support Vector
   Machines (RBF SVMs), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANN). The performance of each method was assessed using the same
   analytical dataset that consists of 861 samples split into drug- and
   fibre type cannabis with drug type cannabis being made up of 12
   varieties (i.e. 12 classes). The results show that linear classifiers
   are not able to manage the distribution of classes in which some overlap
   areas exist for both classification problems. Unlike linear classifiers.
   NNC and RBF SVMs best differentiate cannabis samples both for 2-class
   and 12-class classifications with average classification results up to
   99\% and 98\%, respectively. Furthermore, RBF SVMs correctly classified
   into drug type cannabis the independent validation set, which consists
   of cannabis plants coming from police seizures. In forensic case work

   collection procedures across an array of textiles (cotton, rayon,
   polyester, and wool) to determine an optimized collection method for
   human scent evidence. Six subjects were sampled in triplicate for each
   textile and collection mode, and the samples were then analyzed through
   headspace solid-phase micro-extraction in combination with gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). Contact sampling with
   cotton material has been shown to be the collection method that yielded
   the greatest number of volatile compounds and the highest scent mass
   amounts. Through Spearman rank correlations, it was shown that an
   individual's scent profile is more reproducible within samples collected
   on the same textile type than between different materials. Furthermore,
   contact sampling with cotton fabric demonstrated the greatest
   reproducibility producing the lowest amount of type I and type II errors
   with 90.85\% of the samples distinguished at the 0.9 match/no match

   that damage to the document is avoided or minimised. This paper
   describes a technique for dye identification in ballpoint pen inks using

   imperceptible damage to the surface of the document. Clear mass
   spectrometric identification of the ink dyes is obtained. A case example

Abstract = {{We present a new method based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS) for the nondestructive identification of organic colorants in
   objects whose value or function precludes sampling, such as drawings,
   prints, historic and archeological textiles, handwritten or printed
   documents, and forensic evidence. A bead of a polymer hydrogel loaded
   with a solution containing water, an organic solvent, and a chelating
   agent is used to extract minimal amounts of the colorants from the work
   of art for SERS analysis. Using a gel as a medium for the solvent
   mixture confines its action only to the areas of the work of art covered
   by the gel bead. The gel bead is then removed from the work of art,
   covered with a drop of Ag colloid, and examined with a Raman microscope.
   Transfer of the dye from the substrate to the gel does not require
   removing a sample from the work of art, therefore preserving the
   physical integrity of the object. Spectrophotometric color measurements
   confirm that color change is below the limit perceivable by a human
   observer. Finally, the size of the polymer bead can be reduced to a
   fraction of a millimeter in order to further minimize any impact on the
   work of art, without detriment to the effectiveness of the method. The
   technique has been successfully used for the analysis of a mordant dye
   on the 15th century Netherlandish tapestry, ``The Hunt for the
   Unicorn{''}, and of a synthetic lake pigment on a Meiji period Japanese
   woodblock print.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the morphology of the sinus node of the human
   cardiac conduction system. Until today the sinus node (SN) is described
   as a heterogeneous system composed of 2 types of cells, namely, P or
   pale and Tor transitional cells which are immersed in the matrix around
   the sinus nodal artery. T cells are said to share characteristics of P
   cells and of peripheral working atrial myocardial cells. This study was
   carried out on autoptic and explanted specimens using histochemical,
   immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic methods.
   Our investigations show that SN tissue has a quite different cellular
   composition, ie, spherical and/or star-shaped cells organized in
   clusters with long cytoplasmic processes (type P), transitional cells,
   similar to myocytes but with a reduced number of sarcomeres (type T)
   and, finally, as yet not described in the literature, fibroblast-like
   cells with long bitripolar extensions contacting cells. Interestingly,
   SN is squared by connective and elastic fibers geometrically arranged.
   Immunohistochemistry shows that the 3 cell types of the SN node express
   mesenchymal markers revelatory of their embryological origin.
   Innervation appears to be more complex than previously thought; we
   identified a system of synaptophysin-positive cholinergic vesicles
   dependent on the sympathetic system and parasympathetic fibers
   expressing S100 protein.
   Overall results indicate that the SN has an unexpected, systematic
   architecture.}},

   exposed fibers on the result of the forensic analysis and interpretation

Abstract = {{Cannabis sativa is both an illegal drug and a legitimate crop. The
   differentiation of illegal drug Cannabis from non-drug forms of Cannabis
   is relevant in the context of the growth of fibre and seed oil varieties
   of Cannabis for commercial purposes. This differentiation is currently
   determined based on the levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in adult
   plants. DNA based methods have the potential to assay Cannabis material
   unsuitable for analysis using conventional means including seeds, pollen
   and severely degraded material. The purpose of this research was to
   develop a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay for the
   differentiation of ``drug{''} and ``non-drug{''} Cannabis plants. An
   assay was developed based on four polymorphisms within a 399 bp fragment
   of the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) synthase gene, utilising the
   snapshot multiplex kit. This SNP assay was tested on 94 Cannabis plants,
   which included 10 blind samples, and was able to differentiate between
   ``drug{''} and ``non-drug{''} Cannabis in all cases, while also
   differentiating between Cannabis and other species. Non-drug plants were
   found to be homozygous at the four sites assayed while drug Cannabis
   plants were either homozygous or heterozygous. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a generalized connective tissue
   disorder in which there is calcification of elastic fibers within
   arteries, eyes, and skin. Characteristic features include yellow-orange
   papular skin lesions, angioid streaks radiating out from the optic
   discs, and arterial calcification. The prevalence in the general
   population varies widely from 1/70,000 to 1/160,000. PXE has an
   autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and results from mutations in
   the ATP-binding cassette transporter C6 (ABCC6) that has been mapped to
   16p13.1. Over 300 loss-of-function mutations have been identified.
   Individuals with PXE may come to forensic attention because of sudden
   death involving accelerated coronary atherosclerosis with acute
   myocardial ischemia, systemic hypertension, mitral valve prolapse,
   restrictive cardiomyopathy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and cerebral
   ischemia or hemorrhage. Because of the heritable nature of the disease,
   family counseling and screening are in order when previously unsuspected

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Infrared microspectroscopy is widely used for the chemical analysis of
   small samples. In particular, spectral properties of small cylindrical
   samples are important in forensic analysis, understanding relationships
   between microstructure and mechanical properties in fibers or fiber
   composites, and development of cosmetics and drugs for hair. The
   diameters of the constituent cylinders are typically of the order of the
   central wavelength of light used to probe the sample. Hence, structure
   and material spectral response are coupled and recorded spectra are
   usually distorted to the extent of becoming useless for molecular
   identification. In this paper, we apply rigorous optical theory to
   predict the spectral distortions observed in IR microspectroscopic data
   of fibers. The theory is used, first, to compute the changes that are
   observed for cylinders of various dimensions under different instrument
   configurations when compared to the bulk spectrum from the same
   material. We provide a method to recover intrinsic material spectral
   response from fibers by correcting for distortion introduced by the
   cylindrical structure. The theory reported here should enable the
   routine use of IR microspectroscopy and imaging for the molecular
   analysis of cylindrical domains in complex materials.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes an electrochemically enhanced solid-phase
   microextraction (EE-SPME) method using a mild negative potential (-0.6
   V) for the enhanced extraction of the selected basic drugs in a pure
   aqueous matrix and urine samples. The EE-SPME method gave a more
   effective extraction of drugs (primarily via electrophoresis and
   complementary charge interaction) compared to that obtained with SPME
   (without applying a potential, and which is based on passive
   partitioning). The EE-SPME method eliminated the need for alkalizing,
   derivatizing the drugs, or modifying the fiber coating before
   extraction. The analysis of methamphetamine (MA) and amphetamine (AM)
   was selected as a typical example to demonstrate in detail the
   advantages of EE-SPME over SPME. Based on the results obtained, 3-min
   extraction efficiency for both the amphetamines using EE-SPME was better
   than that of 30-min using SPME. The developed EE-SPME-GC method
   exhibited wide linear ranges (2-1000 ng mL(-1)) for both the
   amphetamines with R-2 larger than 0.99, and the method detection limits
   (MDLs) for AM and MA were 0.26 and 0.12 ng mL(-1), respectively. In
   addition, the EE-SPME method developed was also successfully applied to
   enhance the extraction of several other basic drugs (ephedrine,
   3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), atropine, methadone, cocaine,
   codeine, acetylcodeine and papaverine) with preconcentration factors
   from 157 to 2199, indicating the potential applicability of this method
   in the field of forensic, clinical and pharmaceutical analysis. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This article explores the status, apparatus and character of forensic
   pathology in the inter-war period, with a special emphasis on the
   `people's pathologist', Bernard Spilsbury. The broad expert and public
   profile of forensic pathology, of which Spilsbury was the most prominent
   contemporary representative, will be outlined and discussed. In so
   doing, close attention will be paid to the courtroom strategies by which
   he and other experts translated their isolated post-mortem encounters
   with the dead body into effective testimony.
   Pathologists built a high-profile practice that transfixed the popular,
   legal and scientific imagination, and this article also explores,
   through the celebrated 1925 murder trial of Norman Thorne, how
   Spilsbury's courtroom performance focused critical attention on the
   practices of pathology itself, which threatened to destabilise the
   status of forensic pathology. In particular, the Thorne case raised
   questions about the interrelation between bruising and putrefaction as
   sources of interpretative anxiety. Here, the question of practice is
   vital, especially in understanding how Spilsbury's findings clashed with
   those of rival pathologists whose autopsies centred on a corpse that had
   undergone further putrefactive changes and that had thereby mutated as
   an evidentiary object. Examining how pathologists dealt with
   interpretative problems raised by the instability of their core
   investigative object enables an analysis of the ways in which
   pathological investigation of homicide was inflected with a series of
   conceptual, professional and cultural difficulties stemming in
   significant ways from the materiality of the corpse itself.
   This article presents early findings of a larger study of
   twentieth-century English homicide investigation which focuses on the
   interaction between two dominant forensic regimes: the first, outlined
   in part here, is a body-centred forensics, associated with the lone,
   `celebrity' pathologist, his scalpel and the mortuary slab; the second
   is a `forensics of things' centred on the laboratory and its associated
   technologies of trace analysis (hair, blood, fibres), deployed in closed
   technician-dominated spaces and in the regimentally managed crime scene.
   Future work will seek to illuminate the shifting landscape of English
   forensics by following the historical interplay between these two
   powerful investigative models.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Abstract = {{The first instance in which data from plant DNA was accepted as
   admissible evidence in a criminal case was in Arizona in 1992. This was
   a case that placed a suspect's truck at the scene of a crime by virtue
   of the evidence gained by comparison of the seed pods in the truck to
   those of a Palo Verde tree (Parkinsonia microphylla Torr.) at the scene.
   Dr. Tim Helentjaris, a geneticist at the University of Arizona, agreed
   to try, using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), to produce
   profiles of visualized DNA fragments. 1 This case offers an example of
   the appropriate specimen collection procedure for comparison by Maricopa
   County investigator Charles Norton. The idea behind this chapter is that
   wood fiber is too often neglected or ignored as evidence pertaining to a
   suspect who has forced an entry during the commission of an offense. The
   act of prying a door or window (commonly made of pine), for instance,
   can result in the creation of fiber evidence that is too small for a
   physical match to the pry marks. Those fine fibers logically may yield
   useful DNA evidence capable of placing the suspect or the suspect's
   clothing or tools at the scene. This first chapter is set apart by the
   comparison of specimens rather than markings. This is not the only topic
   in this text that contains some seldom-considered viewpoint or
   information, but it helps to set the tone. It is hoped that the content
   will appeal to practitioners, the legal community, and students who may
   be considering a career in forensics or another of the sciences.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE \& JUSTICE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Two experimental studies were undertaken to investigate the processes of
   reincorporation and redistribution of trace evidence on garments when
   worn by a suspect or a victim ( reincorporation) or after the garments
   have been seized and packaged for subsequent forensic analysis
   (redistribution). The first experiment utilised UV powder, an
   established proxy for geoforensic trace particulates and the second
   experiment utilised daffodil pollen transferred onto garments under
   conditions that mimicked forensic reality. It was demonstrated that
   reincorporation of trace particulates occurs from upper to lower parts
   of the same garment and also from upper garments to lower garments.
   Reincorporation also occurred to all areas of the lower garments,
   however the highest concentration of particulates was found to be the
   lap area of the jeans. Particulates also tended to be preserved around
   technical details such as stitching or relief design features of the
   garments. Thus the decay of particulates after a contact has been made
   does not necessarily involve a loss of those particulates from the
   entire system. These findings have implications for the interpretation
   of trace evidence when seeking to establish the source of initial
   contacts or the chronology of pertinent events. The second study
   demonstrated that folding and packaging items of clothing leads to a
   redistribution of any trace particulate evidence that is present thereby
   eliciting an alteration in the spatial distribution of that evidence.
   There is therefore a necessity to take the context of trace evidence
   into account and also to follow protocols that are sensitive to these
   aspects of trace evidence behaviour as a failure to do so may have
   consequences for the correct interpretation of such evidence. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{A novel fire investigation technique using a needle extraction device

   containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated from fire
   accelerants, gasoline and kerosene were extracted effectively, and
   subsequent gas chromatographic (GC) analyses were successfully carried
   out. Carpet and wood samples were spiked with gasoline and kerosene,
   followed by monitoring of the time-variation profiles of emitted VOCs up
   to 48 h. The fire accelerants were also measured for combusted carpet
   and wood samples, and the applicability of the proposed method to fire
   investigations was confirmed. Even at 48 h after spiking, groups of
   characteristic compounds were clearly observed in the air environments
   near the combusted sample. This method was further applied to the
   determination of VOCs in simulated fires, strongly suggesting the
   applicability of the developed method to real fire investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Test shots at cloth and at human skin from autopsy material were
   performed with 7.62 mm Tokarev (TT), 9 mm Makarov (PM) and 9 x 19 mm
   Clock 19 pistols, using common ammunition.
   The largest central material defects, with fibre deformation in cotton,
   the largest burn holes in polyester, and also many fibre defects caused
   by the perforation of powder, were produced in shots from the IT at all
   distances. Tears in the cloth were longest in the case of the TT at 1 cm
   and were present at 3 cm, whereas the shots from the PM and the Clock 19
   did not leave tears. There were small tears of the edges of the skin
   defect from shots fired from the IT at 1 and 3 cm. On cloth-soot
   deposits at 3 and 5 cm, the radial structures of soot resembled a cobweb
   (the TT), and radial branching structures (the PM) of soot were seen.
   Some shots from the PM left four shafts of rays of soot and formed the
   bullet wipe with four narrow and four wide sections, indicating the form
   of rifling. In the soot deposit from the Glock 19 with hexagonal
   rifling, hexagonal or polygonal or petal-like areas were visible. On
   skin, the soot zones were less distinct. The Clock 19 (at 3 and 5 cm)
   left a lot of gunpowder particles densely around the cloth and skin
   defect. The least powder left on the cloth and skin was by the PM.
   On histological tissue sections, in shots from the TT, a lot of soot and
   gunpowder residue particles in the epidermis and in both layers of the
   dermis, and intraepithelial tears and recesses containing soot, were
   seen. The PM left fine soot and only a few gunpowder particles in the
   epidermis and in the papillary layer of the dermis. The Clock 19
   produced the least soot and a lot of gunpowder particles. The soot and
   most of the gunpowder particles were present on the tissue sections,
   which originated from the central area around the skin defect and were
   detected in the epidermis and in both layers of the dermis. Some tears
   and recesses in the epidermis were also seen. The further the distance
   from the centre of skin defect to the periphery, the depth of the
   penetration of the powder into the skin decreased. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd

   that essentially the same Raman spectrum is obtained on bulk sampling
   from the dye in solution, on viscose, on cotton at different uptakes,
   and on microscope sampling from the dye in cotton threads and single
   fibres. The effects of laser irradiation on the Raman bands and emission
   backgrounds from textile samples with and without dye are also reported.

Abstract = {{The application of LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation inductively coupled plasma
   mass spectrometry) to the chemical characterization of single trunk mat
   fibers made of PET was investigated in order to establish a forensic
   analytical method for the discrimination of samples of different
   origins. The analytical conditions of LA-ICP-MS equipped with a 213 nm
   Nd : YAG laser were optimized to analyze trace elements, such as Cu, Sb,
   and Ba at ppm levels. A total of 31 samples produced by 7 car
   manufactures in Japan were used for analysis. The concentrations of Li,
   Mg, Al, P, Ca, Ti, Co, Cu, Ge, Nb, Sb, Ta, and Pb were successfully
   measured from a single fiber sample with a diameter of ca. 20 mu m. It
   was possible to discriminate all 31 samples based on the analytical
   results of a single fiber by LA-ICP-MS combined with those of FT-IR and
   SEM-EDS. LA-ICP-MS has good analytical sensitivity, and requires a much
   shorter preparation time and a smaller sample size than any other,
   conventional element analysis methods. This paper demonstrates for the
   first time that this method is practically useful as a powerful tool for
   the forensic identification of a single trunk mat fiber.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the novel instrumentation of nanomanipulation
   coupled to nanospray ionization-mass spectrometry, which is used to
   directly probe trace analytes found on individual fibers. The low
   detection limits and sample volumes associated with nanospray
   ionization-mass spectrometry make it the ideal instrument to implement
   for trace analysis. Nanospray ionization-mass spectrometry, coupled with
   the nanomanipulator, allows for the direct probing of trace particulates
   on fibers. The technique is demonstrated by dissolving an electrostatic
   particle of cocaine from a fiber, collecting the analyte solution in a
   nanospray tip, and transferring the tip directly to the mass
   spectrometer to complete analysis. The utility of this technique is
   evident through the minimal sample preparation and short analysis time.
   The use of nanomanipulation coupled to nanospray ionization-mass
   spectrometry could improve on current trace particulate analysis by
   reducing both detection limits and sample size required to complete
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of foreign microparticles in drug products is one of the
   first steps in evaluating the nature of particle contamination and its
   consequences for product quality. To characterize various foreign
   particles, we use spectral database search methods as well as a number
   of microscopic and microspectroscopic techniques. Here, we report a case
   study involving the identification and root-cause investigation of a
   microparticle consisting of four compounds. Foreign microparticles
   consisting of mixtures pose unique challenges for identification as
   their spectra are difficult to interpret and general database searches
   usually return unsatisfactory results. Moreover, sample separation
   through purification and other manipulations is time consuming and often
   difficult for these microparticles due to their small sizes and the
   limited quantities of the components. Here we demonstrate an applicable
   methodology that combines multiple microscopic and microspectroscopic
   techniques to identify a heterogeneous microparticle without the need
   for sample purification or chemical separation. This methodology
   primarily combines Raman, infrared, and energy dispersive X-ray
   microspectroscopic techniques to obtain complementary spectral
   information for the identification of heterogeneous particles. With this
   methodology, the mixed microparticle investigated in this study was
   determined to consist of polyisobutylene, hydrated magnesium silicate,
   titanium dioxide, and silica, likely originating from the vial stopper
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Cannabis cultivation in order to produce drugs is forbidden in
   Switzerland. Thus, law enforcement authorities regularly ask forensic
   laboratories to determinate cannabis plant's chemotype from seized
   material in order to ascertain that the plantation is legal or not. As
   required by the EU official analysis protocol the THC rate of cannabis
   is measured from the flowers at maturity. When laboratories are
   confronted to seedlings, they have to lead the plant to maturity,
   meaning a time consuming and costly procedure. This study investigated
   the discrimination of fibre type from drug type Cannabis seedlings by
   analysing the compounds found in their leaves and using chemometrics
   tools. 11 legal varieties allowed by the Swiss Federal Office for
   Agriculture and 13 illegal ones were greenhouse grown and analysed using
   a gas chromatograph interfaced with a mass spectrometer. Compounds that
   show high discrimination capabilities in the seedlings have been
   identified and a support vector machines (SVMs) analysis was used to
   classify the cannabis samples. The overall set of samples shows a
   classification rate above 99\% with false positive rates less than 2\%.
   This model allows then discrimination between fibre and drug type
   Cannabis at an early stage of growth. Therefore it is not necessary to
   wait plants' maturity to quantify their amount of THC in order to
   determine their chemotype. This procedure could be used for the control
   of legal (fibre type) and illegal (drug type) Cannabis production. (C)

Abstract = {{We encountered a patient who suffered a head injury that translated to
   the optic nerves, leading to dramatic unilateral right optic nerve
   edema. The decedent was a 20-year-old unsecured passenger in a
   convertible. The car collided with a pickup truck. The patient survived
   for 8 h. At autopsy, a comminuted skull fracture involving the right
   frontal bone including the right orbital plate was found. The right
   optic nerve measured 1.2 cm in diameter, compared to only 0.4 cm for the
   left optic nerve. Microscopically, the right optic nerve was markedly
   edematous, but the nerve fibers and nuclei were viable and intact. The
   dramatic difference in size between the right and left optic nerves can
   be attributed to several mechanisms. The survival interval was essential
   for the asymmetrical swelling to take place. Optic nerve trauma is
   relatively rare in head injuries, reported to be present in 0.5\% of
   automobile accidents and assaults. Other causes of optic nerve trauma
   and edema include tumors, osteopetrosis, or reaction to a peripheral
   hemodialysis shunt. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and

Abstract = {{Fibers that are termed ``eco-friendly{''} or ``biodegradable{''} by
   manufacturers are increasingly being used in textile products such as
   apparel and carpeting to appeal to the ever more environmentally aware

   characterize selected fibers of azlon, polylactic acid (PLA), cellulose
   composites of alginate or chitin, and bamboo (viscose rayon). Fiber
   cross-sections, refractive indices, melting points, solubilities, and

   PLA fibers are easily distinguishable from other textile fibers by their
   optical and chemical properties. The cellulose composites show only
   small differences in comparison with other cellulose-based fibers, while
   bamboo viscose rayon is indistinguishable from normal viscose rayon.}},

Abstract = {{The laboratory testing of concrete has shown that elevated temperatures
   cause air permeability index (API) increase and elastic modulus E
   decrease. Indeed, the API response typically spans several orders of
   magnitude making it a sensitive indicator of elastic modulus reduction.
   However, the API versus E data has been historically assumed to be both
   event and concrete composition specific, thus limiting its applicability
   for predictive or modeling purposes. In response, a theoretical model is
   developed here by (1) establishing that the API is equivalent to the
   Darcy permeability; (2) developing a microcrack flow model accounting
   for tortuosity, crack density, and microcrack geometry; and (3)
   interpreting the Giordano and Colombo elastic modulus damage formulas in
   terms of the corresponding increase in permeability. The resulting
   general model depends on stress conditions (plane stress versus plane
   strain) and a single microcrack flow parameter. For materials with small
   Poisson's ratios, however, the model becomes independent of stress
   condition and both equations converge on the same simple solution. The
   model is verified with both field and laboratory data of concrete
   response to typical fire elevated temperatures and shown to be
   comparable in accuracy to previous empirical approaches requiring many
   more degrees of freedom. Moreover, the data on fire damaged concrete
   were found to collapse to a single curve suggesting that the microcrack
   flow parameter is sensitive to elevated temperature but insensitive to
   concrete composition. The success of the model implies certain limits to
   microcrack geometry and airflow turbulence in damaged concrete, both of
   which are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The development of an analytical method for the determination of
   Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol
   (CBN) in samples of human hair is described. Samples were subjected to a
   procedure based on the combination of headspace solid-phase
   microextraction (HS-SPME) with gas chromatography linked with mass
   spectrometry operating in tandem mode (GC-MS/MS). A 10 mg aliquot of
   sample was firstly decontaminated using petroleum ether, deionized water
   and dichloromethane (2 mL of each solvent), for 10 min under sonication,
   and then digested in alkaline solution (1 mol L-1 NaOH). The method
   variables evaluated were pH, mass of hair, fiber type, extraction
   temperature, desorption time, ionic strength, pre-equilibrium time and
   extraction time. Parameters concerning operation of the tandem mode
   MS/MS were also assessed and optimized. Validation of the method
   demonstrated excellent linearity in the range 0.1-8.0 ng mg(-1), with
   regression coefficients better than 0.994. Precision was determined
   using two different concentrations (upper and lower limits of the linear
   range). and RSD values were between 6.6 and 16.4\%. Absolute recoveries
   (measured in triplicate) were in the range 1.1-8.7\%, and limits of
   detection and quantification were 0.007-0.031 ng mg(-1) and 0.012-0.062
   ng mg(-1), respectively. The LOQ for THC (0.062 ng mg(-1)) was below the
   cut-off value (LOQ <= 0.1 ng mg(-1)) established by the Society of Hair
   Testing (SOHT), the Society of Toxicological and Forensic Chemistry
   (STFCh) and the Societe Francaise de Toxicologie Analytique (SETA). The
   optimized SPME method was applied in analysis of hair samples from
   Cannabis drug users, showing that CBN and CBD were present in all
   samples analyzed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) has been
   applied to the direct analysis of sample media for target chemicals,
   including chemical warfare agents (CWA), without the need for additional
   sample handling. During the present study, solid-phase microextraction
   (SPME) fibers were used to sample the headspace above five
   organophosphorus CWA, O-isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (sarin, GB),
   O-pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman, GD), O-ethyl N,N-dimethyl
   phosphoramidocyanidate (tabun, GA), O-cyclohexyl
   methylphosphonofluoridate (cyclohexyl sarin, GF) and O-ethyl
   S-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methyl phosphonothiolate (VX) spiked into
   glass headspace sampling vials. Following sampling, the SPME fibers were
   introduced directly into a modified ESI source, enabling rapid and safe
   DESI of the toxic compounds. A SYNAPT HDMS (TM) instrument was used to
   acquire time-aligned parallel (TAP) fragmentation data, which provided
   both ion mobility and MSn (n = 2 or 3) data useful for the confirmation
   of CWA. Unique ion mobility profiles were acquired for each compound and
   characteristic product ions of the ion mobility separated ions were
   produced in the Triwave (TM) transfer collision region. Up to six full
   scanning MSn spectra, containing the {[}M + H](+) ion and up to seven
   diagnostic product ions, were acquired for each CWA during SPME fiber
   analysis. A rapid screening approach, based on the developed
   methodology, was applied to several typical forensic media, including
   Dacron sampling swabs spiked with 5 mu g of CWA. Background interference
   was minimal and the spiked CWA were readily identified within one minute
   on the basis of the acquired ion mobility and mass spectrometric data.

Abstract = {{Blunt force assault is a growing issue worldwide. In New Zealand,
   recorded cases of grievous blunt force assault increased steadily from
   1011 in 1999 to 2139 in 2008 {[}1]. In many cases of blunt force assault
   victims are struck on parts of their body covered by clothing, yet the
   use of damage to apparel as forensic evidence largely appears to have
   been overlooked. The current research investigated blunt force impact
   (BFI) damage in common apparel fabrics and the effects prior and
   post-laundering had on this damage. Two 100\% cotton fabrics (single
   jersey knit, bull drill) were impacted as single and double layers using
   an impactor representative of a hammer face, the force transmitted
   through specimens was measured and impulse calculated. Impacting and
   laundering were completed cumulatively to establish the effects of

Abstract = {{A fast and simple screening procedure using solid-phase microextraction
   and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) in full-scan mode
   for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOC) is presented.
   The development of a fast and simple screening technique for the
   simultaneous determination of various volatiles is of great importance,
   because of their widespread use, frequent occurrence in forensic
   toxicological questions and the fact that there is often no hint on
   involved substances at the crime scene. To simulate a screening
   procedure, eight VOC with different chemical characteristics were chosen
   (isoflurane, halothane, hexane, chloroform, benzene, isooctane, toluene
   and xylene). To achieve maximum sensitivity, variables that influence
   the SPME process, such as type of fiber, extraction and desorption
   temperature and time, agitation and additives were optimized by
   preliminary studies and by means of a central composite design. The
   limits of detection and recoveries ranged from 2.9 mu g/l (xylene) to
   37.1 mu g/l (isoflurane) and 7.9\% (chloroform) to 61.5\% (benzene),
   respectively. This procedure can be used to answer various forensic and
   toxicological questions. The short time taken for the whole analytical
   procedure may make its eventual adoption for routine analysis
   attractive. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Current protocols for examining hair do not attempt to differentiate

   reference gave the best results, although mounting media such as
   glycerin could also be used. The contribution of the hair substrate is
   predominantly observed in the range of 300-400 nm while the dye peak is
   evident in the range of 425-550 nm. It was found that the presence of
   hair dye reduces the overall intrasample variability of the hair color.
   In addition, visual inspection and spectral interpretation showed that
   dyed hair exhibits distinct and discernable shades. The color of all
   samples was stable during storage and while all hair dyes fade with
   washing, significant fading of the color was only evident after daily
   washing for 3 weeks.}},

   were used in this sensor system, a U-shaped plastic optical fiber with
   high sensitivity act as sensor head. We use amplifying fluorescent

   on to the surface of the U-shaped plastic optical fiber. For the first
   time as far as we know we detected the fluorescence lifetime by the
   phase-fluorometry method to measure the concentration of TNT, which has
   a merit of immunity to fluctuation of the light source and is more
   reliable than measuring intensity alone. In the experimental set-up the
   phase shift between excitation light and fluorescence is calculated by
   correlation method. 2 degree phase difference was measured when the
   sensor head was exposed to TNT vapor and air in primary experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Condition assessment is an imperative for effective power system asset
   management and there is a pressing need to rapidly acquire data on the
   operational performance of high voltage solid and liquid electrical
   insulation systems, both during the manufacturing process as well as in
   the field. These systems are governed by a number of manufacturing,
   operational and environmental variables which affect the time to failure
   in complex ways. Although forensic examination of solid insulation
   failures are commonly conducted and there are many electrical tests to
   assess the condition of the insulation system, there has been limited
   effort to relate remote, non-destructive analysis methods to rapidly
   assess chemical characteristics and physical properties, and to directly
   correlate these to factors that can affect failure. We demonstrate that
   an extension of engineers' visual inspection methods can provide
   correlations to conventional test methods - the results then not only
   provide a predictive capability for insulation condition assessment
   which can support improved approaches to manufacturing, insulation life
   prediction and asset management but also show insights into the chemical
   and physical parameters that effect the desired properties. In addition,
   we suggest that these approaches can be ``wired into{''} the components
   through embedded fiber optics and sensors, providing a continuous
   diagnostic check on the insulation systems.}},

Abstract = {{Mass spectrometry (MS) provides analyte identification over a wide
   molar-mass range. However, particularly in the case of complex matrices,
   this ability is often enhanced by the use of pre-MS separation steps. A
   separation, prototype technique for the ``gentle{''} fractionation of
   large/ultralarge analytes, from proteins to whole cells, is here
   described to reduce complexity and maintain native characteristics of
   the sample before MS analysis. It is based on flow field-flow
   fractionation, and it employs a micro-volume fractionation channel made
   of a ca. 20 cm hollow-fiber membrane of sub-millimeter section. The key
   advantages of this technique lie in the low volume and low-cost of the
   channel, which makes it suitable to a disposable usage. Fractionation
   performance and instrumental simplicity make it an interesting
   methodology for in-batch or on-line pre-MS treatment of such samples.}},

Abstract = {{Selected colored textiles from the Hopewellian Seip Mound group were
   examined visually and photographed. In some cases, the yarns are
   colorant saturated and patterns are nearly identical on both sides of
   the textiles. Several colors, fringe and possibly leather are used as
   decorations. Particulate material shed from these fabrics, or small
   samples strategically removed based on the results of the forensic
   photography, were examined with optical microscopy, revealing that the
   fabrics are made of dyed rabbit hair and bast fibers. The high carbon
   and copper content are signs of mineralization of the fibers. These
   textiles reflect multifaceted textile construction methods by the
   Hopewell with the use of complex dye technology, which could only have
   developed after extensive experimentation to gain dye chemistry
   knowledge. This type of knowledge is likely not commonly held and may be
   associated with special power.}},

   (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), and ammonium nitrate as well as the
   explosives precursors hexamethylenetetraamine (HMTA) and pentaerythritol
   were used in this study. Raman spectra were collected from explosives
   particles with maximum dimensions in the range 5-10 mu m. Despite the
   presence of spectral bands arising from the natural and synthetic
   polymers and dyed textiles, the explosive substances could be identified
   by their characteristic Raman bands. Furthermore, Raman spectra were
   obtained from explosives particles trapped between highly fluorescent
   clothing fibres. Raman spectra of the explosive and explosive precursor
   substances on dyed and undyed clothing substrates were readily obtained

Abstract = {{In order for trace evidence to have a high evidential value,
   experimental studies which mimic the forensic reality are of fundamental
   importance. Such primary level experimentation is crucial to establish a
   coherent body of theory concerning the generation, transfer and
   persistence of different forms of trace physical evidence. We contend
   that the forensic context, at whatever scale, will be specific to each
   individual forensic case and this context in which a crime takes place
   will influence the properties of trace evidence. it will, therefore, be
   necessary in many forensic cases to undertake secondary level
   experimental studies that incorporate specific variables pertinent to a
   particular case and supplement the established theory presented in the
   published literature. Such studies enable a better understanding of the
   specific forensic context and thus allow More accurate collection,
   analysis and interpretation of the trace physical evidence to be
   achieved. This paper presents two cases where the findings of secondary
   level experimental studies undertaken to address specific issues
   particular to two forensic investigations proved to be important.
   Specific pre-, syn- and post-forensic event factors were incorporated
   into the experimental design and proved to be invaluable in the
   recovery, analysis and in achieving accurate interpretations of both
   soil evidence from footwear and glass trace evidence from a broken
   window.
   These Studies demonstrate that a fuller understanding of the specific
   context within which trace physical evidence is generated and
   subsequently collected, as well as an understanding of the behaviour of
   certain forms of trace physical evidence under specific conditions, can
   add evidentiary weight to the analysis and interpretation of that
   evidence and thus help a court with greater certainty where resources
   (time and cost) permit. (C) 2009 Forensic Science Society. Published by

Abstract = {{Single fibers retrieved from a victim's garments and adhered to the
   suspect's automobile have frequently been used to prove the relationship
   between victim and suspect's automobile. Identification method for
   single fiber discrimination has already been conducted. But, a case was
   encountered requiring discrimination of artificial leather fragments
   retrieved from the victim's bag and fused fibers from the bumper of the
   suspect's automobile. In this report, basic studies were conducted on
   identification of artificial leathers and single fibers from leather
   materials. Fiber morphology was observed using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), color of these leather sheets was evaluated by
   microspectrophotometry (MSP), the leather components were measured by
   infrared micro spectrometry (micro-FT-IR) and the inorganic contents
   were ascertained by micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (micro-XRF).
   These two methods contribute to other analytical methods too, in the
   case of utilized single fiber analytical methods. The combination of
   these techniques showed high potential of discrimination ability in
   forensic examinations of these artificial leather samples. In regard
   with smooth surface artificial leather sheet samples, a total of 182
   sheets were obtained, including 177 colored sheets directly from 10 of
   24 manufacturers in Japan, and five of them were purchased at retail
   circulation products. Nine samples of suede-like artificial leather were
   obtained, 6 of them were supplied from 2 manufacturers and 3 sheets were
   purchased as retailing product. Single fibers from the smooth surface
   artificial leather sheets showed characteristic for surface markings,
   and XRF could effectively discriminate between these sheets. The
   combination of results of micro-FT-IR, color evaluation by MSP and the
   contained inorganic elements by XRF enabled to discriminate about 92\%
   of 15,576 pairs comparison. Five smooth surface samples form retailing
   products were discriminated by their chemical composition into four
   categories, and in addition color information to this result, they were
   clearly distinguished. Suede-like artificial leather sheets showed

Abstract = {{A high-surface area solid phase microextraction (HSA-SPME) sampler is
   described for dynamic sampling at high air velocities (up to several
   hundred centimeters per second). The sampling device consists of a thin
   wire coated with carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (carboxen/PDMS) material,
   wound in the annular space between two concentric glass tubes, providing
   a large trapping surface from which analytes may then be thermally
   desorbed with little power consumption upon resistive heating of the
   wire. Desorbed analytes are focused and reconcentrated on a microtrap
   that is subsequently resistively heated to introduce analytes for GC or
   GC/MS analysis. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX)
   included in a 39-component toxic organics (TO-14) gas mixture were used
   to evaluate the efficiency of the HSA-SPME sampler. Quantitation of
   trace-level BTEX compounds present during weapons cleaning was completed
   using stepwise calibration. Detection limits of 0.2-6.9 pptr(v) were
   observed for these analytes using single ion monitoring GC/MS analysis,
   and an improvement in sensitivity of several orders of magnitude was
   achieved when compared to standard dynamic flow SPME with a commercially
   available 10 mm carboxen/PDMS fiber. The potential for rapid analyte
   uptake and improved sensitivity using the HSA-SPME design will make it
   possible to rapidly collect and analyze VOC samples in field settings
   using a portable hand-held pump and a small, low power GC/MS instrument.
   This system will be especially useful for situations involving
   forensics, public safety, and military defensive or intelligence needs
   where rapid, sensitive detection of airborne analytes is required.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of the atomic force microscope (AFM) to investigate the

   for the first time. This study focussed on two natural (cotton and

   various environmental stresses for different lengths of times. Analyses
   of the AFM images allowed us to measure quantitatively the surface
   texture parameters of the environmentally stressed fabrics as a function
   of the exposure time. It was also possible to visualise at the nanoscale
   the finest details of the surfaces of three weathered fabrics and
   clearly distinguish between the detrimental effects of the imposed
   environmental conditions. This study confirmed that the AFM could become
   a very powerful tool in forensic examination of textile fibres to
   provide significant fibre evidence due to its capability of

   the effect of such on severance morphology does not appear to have been

   investigated. Two approaches were used (i) a human participant trial,
   and (ii) guided drop testing (using an impact rig). Force-time plots
   from the human participant trials were matched to those from the impact
   rig. Information on severance morphology was obtained using visual
   analysis techniques. Blades could be differentiated and directionality
   estimated by observing differences in severance shape and size, the
   degree of fabric distortion, the position of severed yarn ends, loop
   snippets, curled yarns, planar array and the morphology of fractured
   fibres. Fabric construction had a visible effect on severance
   morphology. Pre-impact degradation via laundering hindered the ability
   to link fractured fibre ends to a source of damage by altering
   morphology and increasing the variability. The correlation between blade
   height and severance length was weak, attributed to elastic deformation
   and recovery. The impact rig was a valuable tool in the reconstruction
   of textile damage. Damage was consistent when inflicted using a human
   participant trial and the impact rig, although more variable in the
   former. The advantage of the impact rig lies in the ability to produce a
   severance typical of the blade in question, under controlled conditions,
   in a reproducible manner. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A method for the analysis of dyes and vehicles within writing inks was
   developed. The method was tested on a set of 18 black ink pens comprised
   of 6 ballpoint, 6 gel, and 6 rollerball pens. The sampling procedure
   utilized a small number of ink-coated paper fibers collected
   surreptitiously from the document, causing minimal damage and providing
   a sufficient quantity of ink for analysis. Methanol proved suitable for
   the extraction of ink components from ballpoint, gel and rollerball
   pens. Three separate electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
   methods were required to detect the dyes and vehicles from the inks. The
   ions present in the ESI-MS spectra at a signal-to-noise ratio of greater
   than 3:1 provided sufficient information to allow differentiation
   between the inks of each type. A tentative identification of the ink
   components was made based on a comparison of the ions present in the ink
   extract ESI-MIS spectra with the ions present in a series of standards.
   The limits of detection for the standards were generally in the 2.5-10
   ppm range. The method reported here extends the ESI-MS method of ink
   analysis to include gel and rollerball pens, includes the analysis of
   vehicles as well as dyes in the inks and demonstrates a minimally
   destructive sampling method that does not require a ``biopsy{''} of the
   document. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In forensic science, highly sensitive and nondestructive methods have

   SR-XRF (synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectrometry) utilizing

   elemental analysis of forensic small samples. Typical and important
   samples such as glass, titanium dioxide pigments, automotive white
   paints, polyester single fibers, and ceramic prints on automotive glass
   were used to evaluate the utility of this technique for forensic
   discrimination. This technique allowed us to detect trace heavy elements
   such as rare-earth elements as well as relatively light elements in
   samples using K series of emission lines. Then, trace heavy elements
   were useful as characteristic fingerprints, showing the identity of each
   sample with a size of less than 0.5 x 0.5 mm(2). By these results, this
   technique has been demonstrated to be a new system for forensic

Abstract = {{For years the practice of examining fragments of single fibres separated
   from textile products and transferred onto other (foreign) surfaces has
   been applied in order to establish a link between a person or persons
   and an object or the scene of a criminal event. These fibres are
   imperceptible or barely perceptible to the naked eye and can only be
   revealed through the use of certain techniques of securing such
   material. The evidential value of transferred fibre traces, possibly
   coming from a known source and recovered in the case of a specific
   criminal event, depends on a number of factors. The particular
   circumstances of the event, the way in which evidence is gathered at the
   crime scene, the precision of laboratory tests, the colour and type of
   fibres recovered, and the measurable effects of destructive processes
   can all enhance or lessen the evidential value of such material. In this
   publication, the results of multi-aspect research conducted in the area
   of forensic examination of fibres are presented, concerning questions
   relating to the interpretation of analytical results. This research has
   helped to illustrate how important trace fibre evidence can be in

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to investigate a method for the forensic
   elemental analysis of cotton fibers for the purpose of increasing the
   discrimination between otherwise similar cotton evidence using microwave
   digestion inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and
   laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).
   A quadrupole ICP-MS and UV laser ablation (266 nm) instruments were used
   for the analysis. A cotton standard reference material (IAEA V-9) was
   used to validate the developed methods producing good accuracy with
   typically <10\% bias and good precision (typically <5\% RSD) for the
   element list: Mg-25, Al-27, Mn-55, Fe-57, Sr-88 and Ba-137. It was found
   that the LA-ICP-MS method resulted in improved precision over the
   solution ICP-MS method. Twenty-four raw cotton samples and five white
   cotton T-shirts were analyzed with the developed methods. It was also
   found that all the raw cotton samples from different sources were
   distinguishable from each other, as were all the cotton T-shirts
   resulting in zero type I errors and zero type II errors for the pairwise
   comparisons. The laser ablation method was slightly faster than the
   solution-based analysis, requiring similar to 3 h for the laser analysis
   of 10 samples vs. 3.5 h for the solution analysis, including sample
   preparation time. One additional advantage of the LA-ICP-MS method was
   the extremely low sample consumption (similar to 1.75 mu g were consumed
   vs. 250 mg for the solution-based method) and the fact that the LA
   samples are amenable for reanalysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Wood fragments and vegetable fibres were investigated using thermally
   assisted hydrolysis and methylation with pyrolysis gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (THIM PyGC-MS). Multiple ion
   chromatography was used to decrease the interference from cellulosic
   peaks, and to obtain greater resolution between the lignin peaks.
   Forty-four wood samples were analysed using THM PyGC-MS. The wood
   fragments were able to be differentiated into angiosperms (hardwoods)
   and gymnosperms (softwoods) using principle component analysis (PCA),
   hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and the ratio of syringyl to
   guaiacyl lignin fragments (SIG ratio). PCA and HCA also differentiated
   several Monterey pine samples from the rest of the gymnosperms,
   primarily by the presence of P-pinene. an extractive compound. Other
   gymnosperm species and the individual angiosperm species were unable to
   be differentiated. A pilot study investigating the use of THM PyGC-MS
   for the analysis of vegetable fibres in forensic science found that the
   fibre types tended to group into two clusters, with one containing
   cotton, hemp and linen; and the other consisting of hessian, sisal, jute
   and coir. The seagrass sample was able to be differentiated from both
   groups. These groups were well separated using PCA, HCA and by the ratio
   of cinnamyl phenolic derivatives to guaiacyl lignin derivatives (C/G
   ratio). Some grouping of each fibre type was evident within each
   cluster, however the separation between the clusters was insufficient to
   differentiate them using these statistical techniques. THM PyGC-MS of
   vegetable fibres showed some potential for future use in forensic
   science. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   various stains on bank notes, and lipstick stains on paper. Other small
   items encountered in a forensic science laboratory were also analyzed:
   particles of smokeless powder, particles of coffee, and automotive clear
   topcoat layer. The desorbed compounds were analyzed by gas
   chromatography with a flame ionization detector or by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. This device can be used in connection
   with any kind of gas chromatograph. By selection of different injector
   temperatures, fractionated thermal desorption of samples is achieved.
   The procedure was demonstrated on samples of ballpoint pen ink of

Title = {{The spectroscopic detection of drugs of abuse on textile fibres after

Volume = {{189}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{100-103}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Fibres are one of the most common forms of evidence associated with
   forensic investigations. The use of adhesive lifters to recover fibres
   from crime scene samples has long been established as an effective
   method to recover such items of evidence. Once fibres have been lifted
   they are transferred to evidence bags for storage, safe transport and to
   preserve the chain of evidence. This study shows that when fibres are
   tape lifted particles of substances present trapped within those fibres
   are also lifted. Cotton, linen and wool fibres were examined in colours
   ranging from white to black. Samples of seized ecstasy, cocaine,
   ketamine and amphetamine were supplied by East Sussex Police and by the
   TICTAC unit at St Georges Hospital Tooting. The Raman spectra obtained
   showed that it is possible to identify drugs of abuse from particles
   trapped within fibres without interference from the fibre itself. It was
   also possible to obtain spectra after fibres were lifted with adhesive
   tapes without the detection process being compromised. Raman spectra
   from particles of drugs of abuse within fibres following tape lifting
   were also recorded through evidence bags. Again the detection process
   was not compromised. This initial study has shown that fibres have the
   potential to provide even more evidence than they do currently.
   Individuals that have had drugs of abuse about their person may have
   trace amounts of these substances trapped within the fibres of their
   clothing. This may be of particular importance if drugs have been
   carried in pockets of a garment. This technique has the advantage of
   being non-destructive, allows for re-testing, requires no sample
   preparation and also can be performed on samples without removal from
   the evidence bag thus removing any potential risk of contamination. It
   is important however to remember that when dealing with trace amounts of
   drugs of abuse the presence of such particles may be due to innocent
   transfer of such particles. Detection of particles of drugs of abuse on
   clothing does not necessarily indicate criminal activity in the absence
   of other evidence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In one particular criminal case involving murder and theft, the arrested
   suspect admitted to the theft, but denied responsibility for the murder
   of the inhabitant of the crime scene. In his confession, the suspect
   stated that he found the victim's body when he broke into the crime
   scene to commit theft. For this report, the actual crime scene was
   reconstructed in accordance with the confession obtained during the
   interrogation of the suspect, and suspect behavior was simulated in
   accord to the suspect confession. The number of characteristic fibers
   retrieved from the simulated crime scene was compared with those of
   retrieved from the actual crime scene. By comparing the distribution and
   number of characteristic fibers collected in the simulation experiments
   and the actual investigation, the reliability of the suspect's
   confession was evaluated. The characteristic dark yellowish-green woolen
   fibers of the garment that the suspect wore when he entered the crime
   scene were selected as the target fiber in the reconstruction. The
   experimental simulations were conducted four times. The distributed
   target fibers were retrieved using the same type of adhesive tape and
   the same protocol by the same police officers who conducted the
   retrieval of the fibers at the actual crime scene. The fibers were
   identified both through morphological observation and by color
   comparisons of their ultaviolet-visible transmittance spectra measured
   with a microspectrophotometer. The fibers collected with the adhesive
   tape were counted for each area to compare with those collected in the
   actual crime scene investigation. The numbers of fibers found at each
   area of the body, mattress and blankets were compared between the
   simulated experiments and the actual investigation, and a significant
   difference was found. In particular, the numbers of fibers found near
   the victim's head were significantly different. As a result, the
   suspect's confession was not considered to be reliable, as a stronger
   contact with the victim was demonstrated by our simulations. During the
   control trial, traditional forensic traces like DNA or fingerprints were
   mute regarding the suspect's says. At the opposite, the fiber
   intelligence was highly significant to explain the suspect's behavior at
   the crime scene. The fiber results and simulations were presented at the
   court and the man was subsequently found guilty not only of theft and
   trespassing but also murder. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Textile fibers are a key form of trace evidence, and the ability to
   reliably associate or discriminate them is crucial for forensic
   scientists worldwide. While microscopic and instrumental analysis can be
   used to determine the composition of the fiber itself, additional
   specificity is gained by examining fiber color. This is particularly
   important when the bulk composition of the fiber is relatively
   uninformative, as it is with cotton, wool, or other natural fibers. Such
   analyses pose several problems, including extremely small sample sizes,
   the desire for nondestructive techniques, and the vast complexity of
   modern dye compositions. This review will focus on more recent methods
   for comparing fiber color by using chromatography, spectroscopy, and
   mass spectrometry. The increasing use of multivariate statistics and
   other data analysis techniques for the differentiation of spectra from
   dyed fibers will also be discussed.}},

   the three solvents (pyridine/ammonia/water) was modeled and used to
   define optimum conditions for the extraction of three subclasses of acid
   dyes (anthraquinone, azo, and metal complex) from nylon fibers. The
   capillary electrophoresis analysis of acid dye extracts is demonstrated
   using an electrolyte solution of 15 mM ammonium acetate in

Abstract = {{Systematic designed experiments were employed to find the optimum
   conditions for extraction of direct, reactive, and vat dyes from cotton
   fibers prior to forensic characterization. Automated microextractions
   were coupled with measurements of extraction efficiencies on a
   microplate reader UV-visible spectrophotometer to enable rapid screening
   of extraction efficiency as a function of solvent composition. Solvent
   extraction conditions were also developed to be compatible with
   subsequent forensic characterization of extracted dyes by capillary
   electrophoresis with UV-visible diode array detection. The capillary
   electrophoresis electrolyte successfully used in this work consists of 5
   mM ammonium acetate in 40:60 acetonitrile-water at pH 9.3, with the
   addition of sodium dithionite reducing agent to facilitate analysis of
   vat dyes. The ultimate goal of these research efforts is enhanced
   discrimination of trace fiber evidence by analysis of extracted dyes.}},

Abstract = {{Metamerism is a phenomenon where two or more colored items with
   different colorant chemistries appear to the observer to be the same
   color. Those differences should result in different UV-visible spectra.
   Additionally, the literature on color science states that metameric
   samples will have spectra that intersect at three or more loci.
   Metameric samples of blue textile fibers, which were created using
   different coloring agents or different relative concentrations of the
   coloring agents, were studied to demonstrate that they could be
   differentiated by obtaining their spectra between 350 and 800 nm using
   UV-visible microspectrophotometry. However, while some of the metameric
   samples tested did intersect at three or more loci, others did not
   intersect at all. In the spectra that did intersect, no correlation was
   found between either the dye chemistries or the relative component
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A new solid-phase microextraction (SPME) Procedure using an ionic liquid
   (IL) has been developed. Reusable IL-based SPME fiber was prepared for
   the first time by fixing IL through cross-linkage of IL impregnated
   silicone elastomer on the Surface of a fused silica fiber.
   1-Ethoxyethyl-3-methylimidazloium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonylimide
   ({[}EeMim]{[}NTf2]) ionic liquid was employed as a demonstration and the
   prepared fiber was applied to the forensic headspace determination of
   methamphetamine (MAP) and amphetamine (AP) in human urine samples.
   Important extraction parameters including the concentration of salt and
   base in sample matrix, extraction temperature and extraction time were
   investigated and optimized. Combined with gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) working in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, the
   new method showed good linearity in the range of 20-1500 mu g L-1, good
   repeatability (RSD < 7.5\% for MAP, and < 11.5\% for AP. n = 6), and low
   detection limits (0.1 mu g L-1 for MAP and 0.5 mu g L-1 for AP).
   Feasibility of the method was evaluated by analyzing human Urine
   samples. Although IL-based SPME is still at the beginning of its
   development stage, the results obtained by this work showed that it is a
   promising simple, fast and sensitive sample preparation method. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Antipsychotic drugs are among the mostly widely used medications and are
   usually taken for prolonged periods of time. Due to its accumulation and
   trapping of drugs, hair can provide a useful indication of long-term
   exposure. Of interest also is what if any changes in the structural
   components of hair occur as a result of the drug binding process.
   Micro-attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectroscopy is able to examine
   the structural changes of hair samples by the application of sufficient
   pressure and without microtoming the hair (A. Kocak and S. L. Berets,
   Appl. Spectrosc. 62, 803 (2008)). In this investigation, we examined
   changes resulting from exposure of dyed and undyed hair to external
   clozapine as a function of the pH of the exposing solution. Single
   samples from different individuals and in one case front different
   regions of the scalp from the same individual were analyzed. The results
   demonstrated that pH related differences exist between drug-exposed dyed
   and non-dyed samples.}},

Abstract = {{A genetic database was established with the aim of documenting the
   genetic diversity of Cannabis sativa in Australia for future utilization
   in forensic investigations. The database consisted of genotypes at 10
   validated short tandem repeat loci for 510 plants representing drug
   seizures from across Australia and 57 fiber samples. A total of 106
   alleles and 314 different genotypes were detected. All fiber samples
   exhibited unique genotypes while 55\% of the drug samples shared a
   genotype with one or more samples. Shared genotypes were mostly found
   within seizures; however, some genotypes were found among seizures.
   Statistical analysis indicated that genotype sharing was a consequence
   of clonal propagation rather than a lack of genetic resolution. Thus,
   the finding of shared genotypes among seizures is likely due to either a
   common supplier, or direct links among seizures. Notwithstanding the
   potential intelligence information provided by genetic analysis of C.
   sativa, our database analysis also reveals some present limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to show morphological changes of the fornix in
   autopsies of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, which may potentially
   serve for post-mortem diagnosis. Epileptic and non-epileptic autopsy
   brains were obtained from the council of forensic medicine between the
   years 2005 and 2007. In both non-epileptic and epileptic autopsies the
   mean cross-sectional areas and fiber densities of the right and left
   fornices were calculated and analyzed. The numbers of myelinated and
   unmyelinated fibers, and the total number of fibers forming each fornix
   were counted. The total number of fibers in the right fornix was always
   greater than in the left fornix, in both epileptic and non-epileptic
   autopsies. The mean total number of fornix fibers was significantly
   reduced in epileptics compared with non-epileptics, in both the right (p
   = 0.043) and left (p = 0.043) sides. The electron-microscopic sections
   showed that myelinated axons outnumbered unmyelinated axons in both
   epileptic and non-epileptic autopsies. However, the reduction in the
   number of unmyelinated fibers was only statistically significant for the
   right fornix in right epileptic autopsies (p = 0.021). Although the
   reduction in the number of myelinated fibers was not statistically
   significant, electron-microscopic evaluations showed myelin degeneration
   of the myelinated fibers in the right fornix of the right temporal lobe
   in epileptic autopsies. In conclusion, our results suggest that
   unmyelinated fiber loss is functionally important, and may have
   functional consequences of diagnostic value.}},

   extended into the UV range. The discriminating power (i.e. the number of
   discriminated pairs divided by the number of possible pairs) of visible
   range microspectrophotometry was calculated as 0.89 for `mid-blue'
   garments and 0.87 for `dark blue' garments. Extending
   microspectrophotometry into the UV range increased discrimination by
   7\%, giving a discriminating power of 0.96 for both mid and dark blue
   cotton fibres which was similar to that reported by a previous study
   where this method was combined with light and fluorescence microscopy.
   Intra-garment variation was found to be negligible. The implications of
   this study for casework are discussed and a revised analytical pathway
   for the comparison of this fibre type/colour combination using
   microspectrophotometry as a primary screening tool, is proposed. (C)

Abstract = {{THIS is the first study to explore the,forensic science testimony by
   prosecution experts in the trials of innocent persons, all convicted of
   serious crimes, who were later exonerated by post-conviction DNA
   testing. Trial transcripts were sought for all 756 exonerees identified
   as having trial testimony by forensic analysts, of which 737 were
   located and reviewed. These trials most commonly included testimony
   concerning serological analysis and microscopic hair comparison, but
   some included bite mark, shoe print, soil, fiber, and fingerprint
   comparisons, and several included DNA testing. This study found that in
   the bulk of these trials of innocent defendants-82 cases or
   60\%-forensic analysts called by the prosecution provided invalid
   testimony at trial-that is, testimony with conclusions misstating
   empirical data or wholly unsupported by empirical data. This was not the
   testimony of a mere handful of analysts: this set of trials included
   invalid testimony by 72 forensic analysts called by the prosecution and
   employed by 52 laboratories, practices, or hospitals from. 25 states.
   Unfortunately, the adversarial process largely failed to police this
   invalid testimony. Defense counsel rarely cross-examined analysts
   concerning invalid testimony and rarely obtained experts of their own.
   In the few cases in which invalid forensic science was challenged,
   judges seldom provided relief. This evidence supports efforts to create
   scientific oversight mechanisms for reviewing forensic testimony and to
   develop clear scientific standards for written reports and testimony.
   The scientific community can through an official government entity
   promulgate standards to ensure the valid presentation of forensic
   science in criminal cases and thus the integrity and fairness of the
   criminal process.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, liquid-phase microextraction (LPME),a microscale
   implementation of liquid-liquid extraction, has become a very popular
   sample pretreatment technique because it combines extraction and
   enrichment, and is inexpensive, easy to operate and nearly solvent-free.
   Especially so in hollow fiber protected LPME, sample cleanup is also
   effected. Essentially, owing to its high sample-to-extracting solvent
   Volume ratio, LPME call achieve high analyte enrichment. Since its
   advent, the technique has been widely used, and applied to
   environmental, pharmaceutical. biological and forensic analyses. This
   review focuses oil developments relating to chemical reactions
   associated with LPME applications, in contrast to conventional,
   straightforward extractions in which analytes remain as they are during
   the extraction process. Chemical reactions brought about during LPME
   serve to promote the extractability of the analytes (thus expanding the
   scope of applicability of the technique), facilitate their (analyte)
   compatibility with the analytical system and/or improve detection
   sensitivity. The reactions that are usually enabled during LPME include
   ion-pair extraction (carrier-mediated membrane transport), complexation,
   chemical (pre-extraction, in situ, and post-extraction) derivatization,
   phase-transfer catalysis and other ``special affinity{''} reactions.
   Strategies on chemical reactions in LPME are overviewed in this report.

Abstract = {{The past decade has seen increased development and subsequent adoption
   of rapid molecular techniques involving DNA analysis for detection of
   pathogenic microorganisms, also termed microbial forensics. The
   continued accumulation of microbial sequence information in genomic
   databases now better positions the field of high-throughput DNA analysis
   to proceed in a more manageable fashion. The potential to build off of
   these databases exists as technology continues to develop, which will
   enable more rapid, cost effective analyses. This wealth of genetic
   information, along with new technologies, has the potential to better
   address some of the current problems and solve the key issues involved
   in DNA analysis of pathogenic microorganisms. To this end, a high
   density fiber optic microarray has been employed, housing numerous DNA
   sequences simultaneously for detection of various pathogenic
   microorganisms, including Bacillus anthracis, among others. Each
   organism is analyzed with multiple sequences and can be sub-typed
   against other closely related organisms. For public health labs,
   real-time PCR methods have been developed as an initial preliminary
   screen, but culture and growth are still considered the gold standard.
   Technologies employing higher throughput than these standard methods are
   better suited to capitalize on the limitless potential garnered from the
   sequence information. Microarray analyses are one such format positioned
   to exploit this potential, and our array platform is reusable, allowing
   repetitive tests on a single array, providing an increase in throughput
   and decrease in cost, along with a certainty of detection, down to the
   individual strain level.}},

Pages = {{99-112}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the persistence of animal hairs (cat and dog) on
   garments by examining variables such as different types of animal hair,
   different fabric types and differences in fabric features. Hair/fabric
   interactions were found to be far more complex than previous research
   had indicated. Three factors were identified that appeared to account
   for the majority of the differences in persistence. These factors were
   fibre type, yarn or knit tightness and the presence or absence of
   surface fibres on the recipient fabric. For example, the fabric type and
   the structure of the garment were shown to be integral to the mechanism
   of hair persistence. Structure in terms of knit variation or yarn
   tightness and fabric type such as wool with surface fibres appeared to
   exert the most influence on the retention of the animal hair on a
   particular garment. Wool garments had a much shallower initial decay
   where 82\% of the hairs remained after 30 minutes, as opposed to
   polyester garments that exhibited a deep initial decay where only 25\%
   of the hairs remained after 30 minutes. The initial loss-between 0-30
   minutes-of hairs from all fabrics is much more rapid than the loss of
   hairs over all other times. Fabrics such as cotton and polyester appear
   much less retentive than wool and acrylic.}},

Abstract = {{The forensic analysis of sediments recovered from footwear has the
   potential to yield much useful information concerning the movements of a
   person before. during and after a crime has taken place. Three
   experimental studies and a number of examples of forensic casework
   provide insight into the complexity of the spatial distribution of
   geoforensic materials on the soles of footwear and the persistence of
   these materials over time on the soles and uppers. These findings have
   implications for both the geoforensic sampling protocols and procedures
   for footwear submitted for analysis in a criminal investigation and also
   for the analysis of any materials recovered. The preservation of
   sediment on a shoe sole will vary. with certain areas generally
   retaining more sediment than others. The sequential layering of
   sediments that have been transferred to the shoe will be preserved in
   some cases and in certain areas, but generally undergoes complex mixing.
   Such mixing of sediment from different sources occurs both across the
   shoe sole and also through time. It is therefore important to be aware
   of these variations when taking samples For analysis if representative
   samples are to he taken and meaningful interpretation of any analysis
   derived is to be effected. Furthermore, such mixing of pre-, syn- and
   post-forensic event Sources has implications for the appropriateness of
   different analytical techniques. Visual identification techniques which
   are able to identify where such mixing has taken place are preferred to
   forms of analysis that require homogenisation of the sample prior to
   analysis, as this reduces the possibility of false negative or positive
   associations when undertaking comparison of samples in a forensic
   context. The context within which any sampling or analysis is undertaken
   is crucial for a meaningful and accurate interpretation of the
   geoforensic evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Trace evidence is a forensic science term that describes any evidence
   that occurs in very small quantities and which usually requires a
   microscope for visualisation and analysis. Common types include hairs,
   textile fibres, paint fragments, glass, bomb parts, plastics, metal
   fragments and other similar materials. Methods of analysis for trace
   evidence are well accepted and validated. The major challenge has been,
   and continues to be, the discovery and isolation of fragments of trace
   evidence from a matrix such as soil or similar debris. Evidence in
   outdoor crimes such as bombings and tires is especially susceptible to
   difficulties in evidence collection. Traditional methods tor trace
   evidence collection from soils include hand sorting under a low power
   microscope and the use of nested sieves of decreasing mesh size. Both of
   these methods suffer from being extremely time consuming and recovery
   rates are generally very low owing to the difficulty in picking coated
   fragments. The Trace Evidence Concentrator (TEC) system utilises the
   concept of density gradient separation by combining centrifugal forces
   which separate more dense materials from lower density materials. The
   lighter density materials of trace evidence are carried by surface
   tension forces at the air-water interface of small bubbles to a stack of
   multiple sized screens which retain the trace evidence. Additionally,
   the TEC cleans glass fragments, vehicle headlamp filaments, paint chips,
   and unexploded ordnance lost at the scenes of violent accidents and
   crimes. The result is that recovery rates can be dramatically increased
   and search times significantly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{When rope is found at a crime scene, the type of fiber is currently
   identified through its microscopic characteristics. However, these
   characteristics may not always unambiguously distinguish some types of
   rope from others. If rope samples contain cells from the plants of
   origin, then DNA analysis may prove to be a better way to identify the
   type of rope obtained from a crime scene. The objective of this project
   was to develop techniques of DNA analysis that can be used to
   differentiate between ropes made from Cannabis sativa L. (hemp), Agave
   sisalana Perrine (sisal), Musa textilis Nee (abaca, ``Manila hemp{''}),
   Linum usitatissimum L. (flax), and Corchorus olitorus L. (jute). The
   procedures included extracting the DNA from the rope, performing
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the extracted DNA as a template,
   and analyzing the DNA products. A primer pair for PCR, chosen from
   within a chloroplast gene for the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase, was designed to be specific for plant DNA and
   complementary to the genes from all five plants. The resulting PCR
   fragments were approximately 771 base pairs long. The PCR fragments,
   distinguished through base sequence analysis or restriction enzyme
   analysis, could be used to identify the five different rope types. The
   procedure provides a useful addition to visual methods of comparing rope
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{All life forms depend ultimately upon Sunlight to create the energy

   that conversion directly but the rest Of LIS would perish without access
   to foods derived, directly or indirectly, from plants. We also require
   their fibre which We use for clothing, building and other purposes.
   However, plants, just as humans and animals, are attacked by pathogens
   that cause a myriad of symptoms that can lead to reduced yields, lower
   quality products and diminished nutritional value. Plant pathogens share
   many features With their human and animal counterparts. Some pathogens -
   whether of humans, animals, or plants - have nimble genomes or the
   ability to pirate genes from other organisms via mobile elements. Some
   have developed the ability to cross kingdoms in their host ranges. Many
   others share virulence factors, such as the type III secretion system
   (T3SS) or mechanisms for sensing population density, that work equally
   well in all kingdoms. Certain pathogens of hosts in all kingdoms rely
   upon insect vectors and use similar mechanisms to ensure dispersal (and
   sometimes survival) in this way. Plant-pathogen interactions have more
   direct consequence for humans when the microbes are human pathogens such
   as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp., which can contaminate
   fresh produce or when they produce metabolites, such as mycotoxins,
   which are harmful when consumed. Finally, national biosecurity concerns
   and the need for prevention, preparedness and forensic capabilities
   cross all kingdom barriers. Thus, our communities that focus on one of
   these kingdoms have much to learn from one another and a complete and
   balanced `One Health' initiative Must be tripartite, embracing the
   essential components of healthy plants, healthy animals and healthy

   structure of nerve plexus of medial brain artery branches of different
   diameters. In AH, there were changes of the nerve plexus structure in
   brain arterial branches, the intensity of which was related to the
   vessel diameter and disease stage; the decrease of density of
   periadventicial adrenergic nerve plexus compared to controls, which was
   most intensive in AH, stage 1, and in the vessels of smaller size. The
   changes in concentration of distinctly seen bulges (varicosities) were
   more significant compared to those of nervous fibers. The effectiveness
   of nitrooxidergic innervation was also decreased in large vessels and
