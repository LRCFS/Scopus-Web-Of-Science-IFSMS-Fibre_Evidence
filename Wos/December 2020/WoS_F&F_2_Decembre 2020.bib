Abstract = {{Forensic identification of textile fibres that might occur as material
   evidence in crime and/or accidental situations is specific case of fibre
   identification. Although well known method of keratin fibres
   identification i.e. microscopic appearance of fibres (scales,
   medullation, cross section shape...) is one of the most useful
   techniques in forensic fibres identification it might still be more
   useful if it will be utilised as a differentiation tool for recognising
   fibres of individual sub-breed within single animal type (e.g. one sheep
   breed). This paper shows how this can be realised by determination of
   fibre scales microarchitecture.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the application of confocal Raman microscopy to the
   detection and identification of explosives and their precursors in situ
   on undyed natural and synthetic fibres and coloured textile specimens.
   Raman spectra were obtained from explosives particles trapped between
   the fibres of the specimens. The explosives pentaerythritol tetranitrate
   (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), and ammonium nitrate as well as the
   explosives precursors hexamethylenetetraamine (HMTA) and pentaerythritol
   were used in this study. Raman spectra were collected from explosives
   particles with maximum dimensions in the range 5-10 mu m. Despite the
   presence of spectral bands arising from the natural and synthetic
   polymers and dyed textiles, the explosive substances could be identified
   by their characteristic Raman bands. Furthermore, Raman spectra were
   obtained from explosives particles trapped between highly fluorescent
   clothing fibres. Raman spectra of the explosive and explosive precursor
   substances on dyed and undyed clothing substrates were readily obtained
   in situ within 90 s without sample preparation and with no alteration of

Abstract = {{In order for trace evidence to have a high evidential value,
   experimental studies which mimic the forensic reality are of fundamental
   importance. Such primary level experimentation is crucial to establish a
   coherent body of theory concerning the generation, transfer and
   persistence of different forms of trace physical evidence. We contend
   that the forensic context, at whatever scale, will be specific to each
   individual forensic case and this context in which a crime takes place
   will influence the properties of trace evidence. it will, therefore, be
   necessary in many forensic cases to undertake secondary level
   experimental studies that incorporate specific variables pertinent to a
   particular case and supplement the established theory presented in the
   published literature. Such studies enable a better understanding of the
   specific forensic context and thus allow More accurate collection,
   analysis and interpretation of the trace physical evidence to be
   achieved. This paper presents two cases where the findings of secondary
   level experimental studies undertaken to address specific issues
   particular to two forensic investigations proved to be important.
   Specific pre-, syn- and post-forensic event factors were incorporated
   into the experimental design and proved to be invaluable in the
   recovery, analysis and in achieving accurate interpretations of both
   soil evidence from footwear and glass trace evidence from a broken
   window.
   These Studies demonstrate that a fuller understanding of the specific
   context within which trace physical evidence is generated and
   subsequently collected, as well as an understanding of the behaviour of
   certain forms of trace physical evidence under specific conditions, can
   add evidentiary weight to the analysis and interpretation of that
   evidence and thus help a court with greater certainty where resources
   (time and cost) permit. (C) 2009 Forensic Science Society. Published by

Abstract = {{Single fibers retrieved from a victim's garments and adhered to the
   suspect's automobile have frequently been used to prove the relationship
   between victim and suspect's automobile. Identification method for
   single fiber discrimination has already been conducted. But, a case was
   encountered requiring discrimination of artificial leather fragments
   retrieved from the victim's bag and fused fibers from the bumper of the
   suspect's automobile. In this report, basic studies were conducted on
   identification of artificial leathers and single fibers from leather
   materials. Fiber morphology was observed using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), color of these leather sheets was evaluated by
   microspectrophotometry (MSP), the leather components were measured by
   infrared micro spectrometry (micro-FT-IR) and the inorganic contents
   were ascertained by micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (micro-XRF).
   These two methods contribute to other analytical methods too, in the
   case of utilized single fiber analytical methods. The combination of
   these techniques showed high potential of discrimination ability in
   forensic examinations of these artificial leather samples. In regard
   with smooth surface artificial leather sheet samples, a total of 182
   sheets were obtained, including 177 colored sheets directly from 10 of
   24 manufacturers in Japan, and five of them were purchased at retail
   circulation products. Nine samples of suede-like artificial leather were
   obtained, 6 of them were supplied from 2 manufacturers and 3 sheets were
   purchased as retailing product. Single fibers from the smooth surface
   artificial leather sheets showed characteristic for surface markings,
   and XRF could effectively discriminate between these sheets. The
   combination of results of micro-FT-IR, color evaluation by MSP and the
   contained inorganic elements by XRF enabled to discriminate about 92\%
   of 15,576 pairs comparison. Five smooth surface samples form retailing
   products were discriminated by their chemical composition into four
   categories, and in addition color information to this result, they were
   clearly distinguished. Suede-like artificial leather sheets showed
   characteristic extra-fine fibers on their surface by the observation of
   SEM imaging, providing high discriminating ability, in regard with
   suede-like artificial leather sheets were divided into three categories
   by micro-FT-IR, and the combination of these results and color
   evaluation information, it was possible to discriminate all the nine
   suede-like artificial leather sheets examined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{A high-surface area solid phase microextraction (HSA-SPME) sampler is
   described for dynamic sampling at high air velocities (up to several
   hundred centimeters per second). The sampling device consists of a thin
   wire coated with carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (carboxen/PDMS) material,
   wound in the annular space between two concentric glass tubes, providing
   a large trapping surface from which analytes may then be thermally
   desorbed with little power consumption upon resistive heating of the
   wire. Desorbed analytes are focused and reconcentrated on a microtrap
   that is subsequently resistively heated to introduce analytes for GC or
   GC/MS analysis. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX)
   included in a 39-component toxic organics (TO-14) gas mixture were used
   to evaluate the efficiency of the HSA-SPME sampler. Quantitation of
   trace-level BTEX compounds present during weapons cleaning was completed
   using stepwise calibration. Detection limits of 0.2-6.9 pptr(v) were
   observed for these analytes using single ion monitoring GC/MS analysis,
   and an improvement in sensitivity of several orders of magnitude was
   achieved when compared to standard dynamic flow SPME with a commercially
   available 10 mm carboxen/PDMS fiber. The potential for rapid analyte
   uptake and improved sensitivity using the HSA-SPME design will make it
   possible to rapidly collect and analyze VOC samples in field settings
   using a portable hand-held pump and a small, low power GC/MS instrument.
   This system will be especially useful for situations involving
   forensics, public safety, and military defensive or intelligence needs
   where rapid, sensitive detection of airborne analytes is required.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of the atomic force microscope (AFM) to investigate the
   nanoscopic morphological changes in the surfaces of fabrics was examined
   for the first time. This study focussed on two natural (cotton and
   wool), and a regenerated cellulose (viscose) textile fibres exposed to
   various environmental stresses for different lengths of times. Analyses
   of the AFM images allowed us to measure quantitatively the surface
   texture parameters of the environmentally stressed fabrics as a function
   of the exposure time. It was also possible to visualise at the nanoscale
   the finest details of the surfaces of three weathered fabrics and
   clearly distinguish between the detrimental effects of the imposed
   environmental conditions. This study confirmed that the AFM could become
   a very powerful tool in forensic examination of textile fibres to
   provide significant fibre evidence due to its capability of
   distinguishing between different environmental exposures or forced
   damages to fibres. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the effect of such on severance morphology does not appear to have been

   investigated. Two approaches were used (i) a human participant trial,
   and (ii) guided drop testing (using an impact rig). Force-time plots
   from the human participant trials were matched to those from the impact
   rig. Information on severance morphology was obtained using visual
   analysis techniques. Blades could be differentiated and directionality
   estimated by observing differences in severance shape and size, the
   degree of fabric distortion, the position of severed yarn ends, loop
   snippets, curled yarns, planar array and the morphology of fractured
   fibres. Fabric construction had a visible effect on severance
   morphology. Pre-impact degradation via laundering hindered the ability
   to link fractured fibre ends to a source of damage by altering
   morphology and increasing the variability. The correlation between blade
   height and severance length was weak, attributed to elastic deformation
   and recovery. The impact rig was a valuable tool in the reconstruction
   of textile damage. Damage was consistent when inflicted using a human
   participant trial and the impact rig, although more variable in the
   former. The advantage of the impact rig lies in the ability to produce a
   severance typical of the blade in question, under controlled conditions,
   in a reproducible manner. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A method for the analysis of dyes and vehicles within writing inks was
   developed. The method was tested on a set of 18 black ink pens comprised
   of 6 ballpoint, 6 gel, and 6 rollerball pens. The sampling procedure
   utilized a small number of ink-coated paper fibers collected
   surreptitiously from the document, causing minimal damage and providing
   a sufficient quantity of ink for analysis. Methanol proved suitable for
   the extraction of ink components from ballpoint, gel and rollerball
   pens. Three separate electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
   methods were required to detect the dyes and vehicles from the inks. The
   ions present in the ESI-MS spectra at a signal-to-noise ratio of greater
   than 3:1 provided sufficient information to allow differentiation
   between the inks of each type. A tentative identification of the ink
   components was made based on a comparison of the ions present in the ink
   extract ESI-MIS spectra with the ions present in a series of standards.
   The limits of detection for the standards were generally in the 2.5-10
   ppm range. The method reported here extends the ESI-MS method of ink
   analysis to include gel and rollerball pens, includes the analysis of
   vehicles as well as dyes in the inks and demonstrates a minimally
   destructive sampling method that does not require a ``biopsy{''} of the
   document. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In forensic science, highly sensitive and nondestructive methods have
   been required to discriminate a small amount of evidence found at
   criminal scenes. This doctoral thesis demonstrates that high-energy
   SR-XRF (synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectrometry) utilizing
   116 and 75 keV X-rays at SPring-8 is a powerful technique for trace
   elemental analysis of forensic small samples. Typical and important
   samples such as glass, titanium dioxide pigments, automotive white
   paints, polyester single fibers, and ceramic prints on automotive glass
   were used to evaluate the utility of this technique for forensic
   discrimination. This technique allowed us to detect trace heavy elements
   such as rare-earth elements as well as relatively light elements in
   samples using K series of emission lines. Then, trace heavy elements
   were useful as characteristic fingerprints, showing the identity of each
   sample with a size of less than 0.5 x 0.5 mm(2). By these results, this
   technique has been demonstrated to be a new system for forensic
   examination, and is being applied to practical analyses of various

Abstract = {{For years the practice of examining fragments of single fibres separated
   from textile products and transferred onto other (foreign) surfaces has
   been applied in order to establish a link between a person or persons
   and an object or the scene of a criminal event. These fibres are
   imperceptible or barely perceptible to the naked eye and can only be
   revealed through the use of certain techniques of securing such
   material. The evidential value of transferred fibre traces, possibly
   coming from a known source and recovered in the case of a specific
   criminal event, depends on a number of factors. The particular
   circumstances of the event, the way in which evidence is gathered at the
   crime scene, the precision of laboratory tests, the colour and type of
   fibres recovered, and the measurable effects of destructive processes
   can all enhance or lessen the evidential value of such material. In this
   publication, the results of multi-aspect research conducted in the area
   of forensic examination of fibres are presented, concerning questions
   relating to the interpretation of analytical results. This research has
   helped to illustrate how important trace fibre evidence can be in
   clarifying the circumstances of a wide range of crimes.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to investigate a method for the forensic
   elemental analysis of cotton fibers for the purpose of increasing the
   discrimination between otherwise similar cotton evidence using microwave
   digestion inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and
   laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).
   A quadrupole ICP-MS and UV laser ablation (266 nm) instruments were used
   for the analysis. A cotton standard reference material (IAEA V-9) was
   used to validate the developed methods producing good accuracy with
   typically <10\% bias and good precision (typically <5\% RSD) for the
   element list: Mg-25, Al-27, Mn-55, Fe-57, Sr-88 and Ba-137. It was found
   that the LA-ICP-MS method resulted in improved precision over the
   solution ICP-MS method. Twenty-four raw cotton samples and five white
   cotton T-shirts were analyzed with the developed methods. It was also
   found that all the raw cotton samples from different sources were
   distinguishable from each other, as were all the cotton T-shirts
   resulting in zero type I errors and zero type II errors for the pairwise
   comparisons. The laser ablation method was slightly faster than the
   solution-based analysis, requiring similar to 3 h for the laser analysis
   of 10 samples vs. 3.5 h for the solution analysis, including sample
   preparation time. One additional advantage of the LA-ICP-MS method was
   the extremely low sample consumption (similar to 1.75 mu g were consumed
   vs. 250 mg for the solution-based method) and the fact that the LA
   samples are amenable for reanalysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Wood fragments and vegetable fibres were investigated using thermally
   assisted hydrolysis and methylation with pyrolysis gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (THIM PyGC-MS). Multiple ion
   chromatography was used to decrease the interference from cellulosic
   peaks, and to obtain greater resolution between the lignin peaks.
   Forty-four wood samples were analysed using THM PyGC-MS. The wood
   fragments were able to be differentiated into angiosperms (hardwoods)
   and gymnosperms (softwoods) using principle component analysis (PCA),
   hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and the ratio of syringyl to
   guaiacyl lignin fragments (SIG ratio). PCA and HCA also differentiated
   several Monterey pine samples from the rest of the gymnosperms,
   primarily by the presence of P-pinene. an extractive compound. Other
   gymnosperm species and the individual angiosperm species were unable to
   be differentiated. A pilot study investigating the use of THM PyGC-MS
   for the analysis of vegetable fibres in forensic science found that the
   fibre types tended to group into two clusters, with one containing
   cotton, hemp and linen; and the other consisting of hessian, sisal, jute
   and coir. The seagrass sample was able to be differentiated from both
   groups. These groups were well separated using PCA, HCA and by the ratio
   of cinnamyl phenolic derivatives to guaiacyl lignin derivatives (C/G
   ratio). Some grouping of each fibre type was evident within each
   cluster, however the separation between the clusters was insufficient to
   differentiate them using these statistical techniques. THM PyGC-MS of
   vegetable fibres showed some potential for future use in forensic
   science. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess colour changes that occur in several
   types of commonly available textiles as a result of the long-term
   effects of various popularly used laundry detergents. A 14 day
   experiment was conducted using blue, red and grey/black cotton, wool,
   acrylic and polyester textiles. Colour changes were evaluated through
   the Visual comparison of the colour of the textile samples against that
   of the untreated (control) material.
   The kinetics of the changes in the colour of the fibres were monitored
   using fluorescence microscopy (UV excitation filter). The conclusions
   include an assessment of the observed changes from a fibre analysis
   expert's point of view, as well as that of an average User/consumer of

Title = {{The spectroscopic detection of drugs of abuse on textile fibres after

Abstract = {{Fibres are one of the most common forms of evidence associated with
   forensic investigations. The use of adhesive lifters to recover fibres
   from crime scene samples has long been established as an effective
   method to recover such items of evidence. Once fibres have been lifted
   they are transferred to evidence bags for storage, safe transport and to
   preserve the chain of evidence. This study shows that when fibres are
   tape lifted particles of substances present trapped within those fibres
   are also lifted. Cotton, linen and wool fibres were examined in colours
   ranging from white to black. Samples of seized ecstasy, cocaine,
   ketamine and amphetamine were supplied by East Sussex Police and by the
   TICTAC unit at St Georges Hospital Tooting. The Raman spectra obtained
   showed that it is possible to identify drugs of abuse from particles
   trapped within fibres without interference from the fibre itself. It was
   also possible to obtain spectra after fibres were lifted with adhesive
   tapes without the detection process being compromised. Raman spectra
   from particles of drugs of abuse within fibres following tape lifting
   were also recorded through evidence bags. Again the detection process
   was not compromised. This initial study has shown that fibres have the
   potential to provide even more evidence than they do currently.
   Individuals that have had drugs of abuse about their person may have
   trace amounts of these substances trapped within the fibres of their
   clothing. This may be of particular importance if drugs have been
   carried in pockets of a garment. This technique has the advantage of
   being non-destructive, allows for re-testing, requires no sample
   preparation and also can be performed on samples without removal from
   the evidence bag thus removing any potential risk of contamination. It
   is important however to remember that when dealing with trace amounts of
   drugs of abuse the presence of such particles may be due to innocent
   transfer of such particles. Detection of particles of drugs of abuse on
   clothing does not necessarily indicate criminal activity in the absence
   of other evidence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In one particular criminal case involving murder and theft, the arrested
   suspect admitted to the theft, but denied responsibility for the murder
   of the inhabitant of the crime scene. In his confession, the suspect
   stated that he found the victim's body when he broke into the crime
   scene to commit theft. For this report, the actual crime scene was
   reconstructed in accordance with the confession obtained during the
   interrogation of the suspect, and suspect behavior was simulated in
   accord to the suspect confession. The number of characteristic fibers
   retrieved from the simulated crime scene was compared with those of
   retrieved from the actual crime scene. By comparing the distribution and
   number of characteristic fibers collected in the simulation experiments
   and the actual investigation, the reliability of the suspect's
   confession was evaluated. The characteristic dark yellowish-green woolen
   fibers of the garment that the suspect wore when he entered the crime
   scene were selected as the target fiber in the reconstruction. The
   experimental simulations were conducted four times. The distributed
   target fibers were retrieved using the same type of adhesive tape and
   the same protocol by the same police officers who conducted the
   retrieval of the fibers at the actual crime scene. The fibers were
   identified both through morphological observation and by color
   comparisons of their ultaviolet-visible transmittance spectra measured
   with a microspectrophotometer. The fibers collected with the adhesive
   tape were counted for each area to compare with those collected in the
   actual crime scene investigation. The numbers of fibers found at each
   area of the body, mattress and blankets were compared between the
   simulated experiments and the actual investigation, and a significant
   difference was found. In particular, the numbers of fibers found near
   the victim's head were significantly different. As a result, the
   suspect's confession was not considered to be reliable, as a stronger
   contact with the victim was demonstrated by our simulations. During the
   control trial, traditional forensic traces like DNA or fingerprints were
   mute regarding the suspect's says. At the opposite, the fiber
   intelligence was highly significant to explain the suspect's behavior at
   the crime scene. The fiber results and simulations were presented at the
   court and the man was subsequently found guilty not only of theft and
   trespassing but also murder. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Textile fibers are a key form of trace evidence, and the ability to
   reliably associate or discriminate them is crucial for forensic
   scientists worldwide. While microscopic and instrumental analysis can be
   used to determine the composition of the fiber itself, additional
   specificity is gained by examining fiber color. This is particularly
   important when the bulk composition of the fiber is relatively
   uninformative, as it is with cotton, wool, or other natural fibers. Such
   analyses pose several problems, including extremely small sample sizes,
   the desire for nondestructive techniques, and the vast complexity of
   modern dye compositions. This review will focus on more recent methods
   for comparing fiber color by using chromatography, spectroscopy, and
   mass spectrometry. The increasing use of multivariate statistics and
   other data analysis techniques for the differentiation of spectra from
   dyed fibers will also be discussed.}},

   various extraction durations. The extraction efficiency as a function of
   the three solvents (pyridine/ammonia/water) was modeled and used to
   define optimum conditions for the extraction of three subclasses of acid
   dyes (anthraquinone, azo, and metal complex) from nylon fibers. The
   capillary electrophoresis analysis of acid dye extracts is demonstrated
   using an electrolyte solution of 15 mM ammonium acetate in

Abstract = {{Metamerism is a phenomenon where two or more colored items with
   different colorant chemistries appear to the observer to be the same

   Additionally, the literature on color science states that metameric
   samples will have spectra that intersect at three or more loci.
   Metameric samples of blue textile fibers, which were created using
   different coloring agents or different relative concentrations of the
   coloring agents, were studied to demonstrate that they could be
   differentiated by obtaining their spectra between 350 and 800 nm using
   UV-visible microspectrophotometry. However, while some of the metameric
   samples tested did intersect at three or more loci, others did not
   intersect at all. In the spectra that did intersect, no correlation was

   1-Ethoxyethyl-3-methylimidazloium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonylimide
   ({[}EeMim]{[}NTf2]) ionic liquid was employed as a demonstration and the
   prepared fiber was applied to the forensic headspace determination of
   methamphetamine (MAP) and amphetamine (AP) in human urine samples.
   Important extraction parameters including the concentration of salt and
   base in sample matrix, extraction temperature and extraction time were
   investigated and optimized. Combined with gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) working in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, the
   new method showed good linearity in the range of 20-1500 mu g L-1, good
   repeatability (RSD < 7.5\% for MAP, and < 11.5\% for AP. n = 6), and low
   detection limits (0.1 mu g L-1 for MAP and 0.5 mu g L-1 for AP).
   Feasibility of the method was evaluated by analyzing human Urine
   samples. Although IL-based SPME is still at the beginning of its
   development stage, the results obtained by this work showed that it is a
   promising simple, fast and sensitive sample preparation method. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Antipsychotic drugs are among the mostly widely used medications and are
   usually taken for prolonged periods of time. Due to its accumulation and
   trapping of drugs, hair can provide a useful indication of long-term
   exposure. Of interest also is what if any changes in the structural
   components of hair occur as a result of the drug binding process.
   Micro-attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectroscopy is able to examine
   the structural changes of hair samples by the application of sufficient
   pressure and without microtoming the hair (A. Kocak and S. L. Berets,
   Appl. Spectrosc. 62, 803 (2008)). In this investigation, we examined
   changes resulting from exposure of dyed and undyed hair to external
   clozapine as a function of the pH of the exposing solution. Single
   samples from different individuals and in one case front different
   regions of the scalp from the same individual were analyzed. The results
   demonstrated that pH related differences exist between drug-exposed dyed
   and non-dyed samples.}},

Abstract = {{A genetic database was established with the aim of documenting the
   genetic diversity of Cannabis sativa in Australia for future utilization
   in forensic investigations. The database consisted of genotypes at 10
   validated short tandem repeat loci for 510 plants representing drug
   seizures from across Australia and 57 fiber samples. A total of 106
   alleles and 314 different genotypes were detected. All fiber samples
   exhibited unique genotypes while 55\% of the drug samples shared a
   genotype with one or more samples. Shared genotypes were mostly found
   within seizures; however, some genotypes were found among seizures.
   Statistical analysis indicated that genotype sharing was a consequence
   of clonal propagation rather than a lack of genetic resolution. Thus,
   the finding of shared genotypes among seizures is likely due to either a
   common supplier, or direct links among seizures. Notwithstanding the
   potential intelligence information provided by genetic analysis of C.
   sativa, our database analysis also reveals some present limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to show morphological changes of the fornix in
   autopsies of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, which may potentially
   serve for post-mortem diagnosis. Epileptic and non-epileptic autopsy
   brains were obtained from the council of forensic medicine between the
   years 2005 and 2007. In both non-epileptic and epileptic autopsies the
   mean cross-sectional areas and fiber densities of the right and left
   fornices were calculated and analyzed. The numbers of myelinated and
   unmyelinated fibers, and the total number of fibers forming each fornix
   were counted. The total number of fibers in the right fornix was always
   greater than in the left fornix, in both epileptic and non-epileptic
   autopsies. The mean total number of fornix fibers was significantly
   reduced in epileptics compared with non-epileptics, in both the right (p
   = 0.043) and left (p = 0.043) sides. The electron-microscopic sections
   showed that myelinated axons outnumbered unmyelinated axons in both
   epileptic and non-epileptic autopsies. However, the reduction in the
   number of unmyelinated fibers was only statistically significant for the
   right fornix in right epileptic autopsies (p = 0.021). Although the
   reduction in the number of myelinated fibers was not statistically
   significant, electron-microscopic evaluations showed myelin degeneration
   of the myelinated fibers in the right fornix of the right temporal lobe
   in epileptic autopsies. In conclusion, our results suggest that
   unmyelinated fiber loss is functionally important, and may have
   functional consequences of diagnostic value.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the degree of discrimination

   microspectrophotometry alone. To this end, samples of fibres were taken
   from 100, nondenim, blue cotton, outer garments. including t-shirts.
   trousers and jumpers and subjected to analysis by both visible and UV
   range microspectrophotometry. The results obtained from the samples of
   each garment were compared to determine if they `matched' or not From an
   initial visual comparison of the garments it was possible to subdivide
   the samples into two populations consisting of 73 `dark blue' garments
   and 27 `mid-blue' garments. It was found that of the 73 `dark blue'
   garments, 22 distinct sub-populations could be distinguished using
   visible range MSP this figure being increased to 43 when the analysis
   was extended into the UV range. In the case of the 27 `mid-blue'
   garments, 9 distinct sub-populations were discriminated using visible
   range MSP, this figure being increased to 17 when the analysis was
   extended into the UV range. The discriminating power (i.e. the number of
   discriminated pairs divided by the number of possible pairs) of visible
   range microspectrophotometry was calculated as 0.89 for `mid-blue'
   garments and 0.87 for `dark blue' garments. Extending
   microspectrophotometry into the UV range increased discrimination by
   7\%, giving a discriminating power of 0.96 for both mid and dark blue
   cotton fibres which was similar to that reported by a previous study
   where this method was combined with light and fluorescence microscopy.
   Intra-garment variation was found to be negligible. The implications of
   this study for casework are discussed and a revised analytical pathway
   for the comparison of this fibre type/colour combination using
   microspectrophotometry as a primary screening tool, is proposed. (C)

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-97}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{THIS is the first study to explore the,forensic science testimony by
   prosecution experts in the trials of innocent persons, all convicted of
   serious crimes, who were later exonerated by post-conviction DNA
   testing. Trial transcripts were sought for all 756 exonerees identified
   as having trial testimony by forensic analysts, of which 737 were
   located and reviewed. These trials most commonly included testimony
   concerning serological analysis and microscopic hair comparison, but
   some included bite mark, shoe print, soil, fiber, and fingerprint
   comparisons, and several included DNA testing. This study found that in
   the bulk of these trials of innocent defendants-82 cases or
   60\%-forensic analysts called by the prosecution provided invalid
   testimony at trial-that is, testimony with conclusions misstating
   empirical data or wholly unsupported by empirical data. This was not the
   testimony of a mere handful of analysts: this set of trials included
   invalid testimony by 72 forensic analysts called by the prosecution and
   employed by 52 laboratories, practices, or hospitals from. 25 states.
   Unfortunately, the adversarial process largely failed to police this
   invalid testimony. Defense counsel rarely cross-examined analysts
   concerning invalid testimony and rarely obtained experts of their own.
   In the few cases in which invalid forensic science was challenged,
   judges seldom provided relief. This evidence supports efforts to create
   scientific oversight mechanisms for reviewing forensic testimony and to
   develop clear scientific standards for written reports and testimony.
   The scientific community can through an official government entity
   promulgate standards to ensure the valid presentation of forensic
   science in criminal cases and thus the integrity and fairness of the
   criminal process.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, liquid-phase microextraction (LPME),a microscale

   Especially so in hollow fiber protected LPME, sample cleanup is also
   effected. Essentially, owing to its high sample-to-extracting solvent
   Volume ratio, LPME call achieve high analyte enrichment. Since its
   advent, the technique has been widely used, and applied to

   review focuses oil developments relating to chemical reactions

   straightforward extractions in which analytes remain as they are during
   the extraction process. Chemical reactions brought about during LPME
   serve to promote the extractability of the analytes (thus expanding the
   scope of applicability of the technique), facilitate their (analyte)
   compatibility with the analytical system and/or improve detection
   sensitivity. The reactions that are usually enabled during LPME include
   ion-pair extraction (carrier-mediated membrane transport), complexation,
   chemical (pre-extraction, in situ, and post-extraction) derivatization,
   phase-transfer catalysis and other ``special affinity{''} reactions.
   Strategies on chemical reactions in LPME are overviewed in this report.

Abstract = {{The past decade has seen increased development and subsequent adoption
   of rapid molecular techniques involving DNA analysis for detection of
   pathogenic microorganisms, also termed microbial forensics. The
   continued accumulation of microbial sequence information in genomic
   databases now better positions the field of high-throughput DNA analysis
   to proceed in a more manageable fashion. The potential to build off of
   these databases exists as technology continues to develop, which will
   enable more rapid, cost effective analyses. This wealth of genetic
   information, along with new technologies, has the potential to better
   address some of the current problems and solve the key issues involved
   in DNA analysis of pathogenic microorganisms. To this end, a high
   density fiber optic microarray has been employed, housing numerous DNA
   sequences simultaneously for detection of various pathogenic
   microorganisms, including Bacillus anthracis, among others. Each
   organism is analyzed with multiple sequences and can be sub-typed
   against other closely related organisms. For public health labs,
   real-time PCR methods have been developed as an initial preliminary
   screen, but culture and growth are still considered the gold standard.
   Technologies employing higher throughput than these standard methods are
   better suited to capitalize on the limitless potential garnered from the
   sequence information. Microarray analyses are one such format positioned
   to exploit this potential, and our array platform is reusable, allowing
   repetitive tests on a single array, providing an increase in throughput
   and decrease in cost, along with a certainty of detection, down to the
   individual strain level.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the persistence of animal hairs (cat and dog) on
   garments by examining variables such as different types of animal hair,
   different fabric types and differences in fabric features. Hair/fabric
   interactions were found to be far more complex than previous research
   had indicated. Three factors were identified that appeared to account
   for the majority of the differences in persistence. These factors were
   fibre type, yarn or knit tightness and the presence or absence of
   surface fibres on the recipient fabric. For example, the fabric type and
   the structure of the garment were shown to be integral to the mechanism
   of hair persistence. Structure in terms of knit variation or yarn
   tightness and fabric type such as wool with surface fibres appeared to
   exert the most influence on the retention of the animal hair on a
   particular garment. Wool garments had a much shallower initial decay
   where 82\% of the hairs remained after 30 minutes, as opposed to
   polyester garments that exhibited a deep initial decay where only 25\%
   of the hairs remained after 30 minutes. The initial loss-between 0-30
   minutes-of hairs from all fabrics is much more rapid than the loss of
   hairs over all other times. Fabrics such as cotton and polyester appear
   much less retentive than wool and acrylic.}},

Abstract = {{The forensic analysis of sediments recovered from footwear has the
   potential to yield much useful information concerning the movements of a
   person before. during and after a crime has taken place. Three
   experimental studies and a number of examples of forensic casework
   provide insight into the complexity of the spatial distribution of
   geoforensic materials on the soles of footwear and the persistence of
   these materials over time on the soles and uppers. These findings have
   implications for both the geoforensic sampling protocols and procedures
   for footwear submitted for analysis in a criminal investigation and also
   for the analysis of any materials recovered. The preservation of
   sediment on a shoe sole will vary. with certain areas generally
   retaining more sediment than others. The sequential layering of
   sediments that have been transferred to the shoe will be preserved in
   some cases and in certain areas, but generally undergoes complex mixing.
   Such mixing of sediment from different sources occurs both across the
   shoe sole and also through time. It is therefore important to be aware
   of these variations when taking samples For analysis if representative
   samples are to he taken and meaningful interpretation of any analysis
   derived is to be effected. Furthermore, such mixing of pre-, syn- and
   post-forensic event Sources has implications for the appropriateness of
   different analytical techniques. Visual identification techniques which
   are able to identify where such mixing has taken place are preferred to
   forms of analysis that require homogenisation of the sample prior to
   analysis, as this reduces the possibility of false negative or positive
   associations when undertaking comparison of samples in a forensic
   context. The context within which any sampling or analysis is undertaken
   is crucial for a meaningful and accurate interpretation of the
   geoforensic evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Trace evidence is a forensic science term that describes any evidence
   that occurs in very small quantities and which usually requires a
   microscope for visualisation and analysis. Common types include hairs,
   textile fibres, paint fragments, glass, bomb parts, plastics, metal
   fragments and other similar materials. Methods of analysis for trace
   evidence are well accepted and validated. The major challenge has been,
   and continues to be, the discovery and isolation of fragments of trace
   evidence from a matrix such as soil or similar debris. Evidence in
   outdoor crimes such as bombings and tires is especially susceptible to
   difficulties in evidence collection. Traditional methods tor trace
   evidence collection from soils include hand sorting under a low power
   microscope and the use of nested sieves of decreasing mesh size. Both of
   these methods suffer from being extremely time consuming and recovery
   rates are generally very low owing to the difficulty in picking coated
   fragments. The Trace Evidence Concentrator (TEC) system utilises the
   concept of density gradient separation by combining centrifugal forces
   which separate more dense materials from lower density materials. The
   lighter density materials of trace evidence are carried by surface
   tension forces at the air-water interface of small bubbles to a stack of
   multiple sized screens which retain the trace evidence. Additionally,
   the TEC cleans glass fragments, vehicle headlamp filaments, paint chips,
   and unexploded ordnance lost at the scenes of violent accidents and
   crimes. The result is that recovery rates can be dramatically increased
   and search times significantly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{The colour of fibre, present naturally or imparted through use of a dye

Abstract = {{When rope is found at a crime scene, the type of fiber is currently
   identified through its microscopic characteristics. However, these
   characteristics may not always unambiguously distinguish some types of
   rope from others. If rope samples contain cells from the plants of
   origin, then DNA analysis may prove to be a better way to identify the
   type of rope obtained from a crime scene. The objective of this project
   was to develop techniques of DNA analysis that can be used to
   differentiate between ropes made from Cannabis sativa L. (hemp), Agave
   sisalana Perrine (sisal), Musa textilis Nee (abaca, ``Manila hemp{''}),
   Linum usitatissimum L. (flax), and Corchorus olitorus L. (jute). The
   procedures included extracting the DNA from the rope, performing
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the extracted DNA as a template,
   and analyzing the DNA products. A primer pair for PCR, chosen from
   within a chloroplast gene for the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase, was designed to be specific for plant DNA and
   complementary to the genes from all five plants. The resulting PCR
   fragments were approximately 771 base pairs long. The PCR fragments,
   distinguished through base sequence analysis or restriction enzyme
   analysis, could be used to identify the five different rope types. The
   procedure provides a useful addition to visual methods of comparing rope
   samples.}},

   However, plants, just as humans and animals, are attacked by pathogens

   quality products and diminished nutritional value. Plant pathogens share
   many features With their human and animal counterparts. Some pathogens -
   whether of humans, animals, or plants - have nimble genomes or the
   ability to pirate genes from other organisms via mobile elements. Some
   have developed the ability to cross kingdoms in their host ranges. Many
   others share virulence factors, such as the type III secretion system
   (T3SS) or mechanisms for sensing population density, that work equally
   well in all kingdoms. Certain pathogens of hosts in all kingdoms rely
   upon insect vectors and use similar mechanisms to ensure dispersal (and
   sometimes survival) in this way. Plant-pathogen interactions have more
   direct consequence for humans when the microbes are human pathogens such
   as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp., which can contaminate
   fresh produce or when they produce metabolites, such as mycotoxins,
   which are harmful when consumed. Finally, national biosecurity concerns
   and the need for prevention, preparedness and forensic capabilities
   cross all kingdom barriers. Thus, our communities that focus on one of

   elements and organic compounds in red sealing-inks. An analysis was
   performed on five sealing-inks of red color manufactured in Korea,
   Japan, and China. Several fibers from specific sealing-ink sample on
   paper can be removed leaving little evidence of tampering and can be
   distinguished from other sealing-inks. Overlapped area of sealing-ink
   and ballpoint pen in the document was also investigated in order to
   identify the sequence of recording. Therefore, this study shows that

Abstract = {{Polarized attenuated total reflection (ATR) infrared spectroscopy is an
   efficient technique to determine the orientation and conformation of a
   large variety of samples, but it is more difficult to apply to very
   small specimens such as silk fibers. The Golden Gate single-reflection
   ATR accessory that uses diamond as an ATR element and a focalized beam
   turns out to be highly efficient to study quantitatively the orientation
   and conformation of a single silk fibroin filament of the silkworm
   Bombyx mori that is about 10 mu m in diameter. For orientation
   measurements, rotating the sample instead of the electric field greatly
   simplifies the theoretical analysis and keeps the penetration depth of
   the infrared radiation constant. A sample holder that can be fitted on
   the ATR accessory has thus been developed to allow accurate rotation of
   the sample and to obtain spectra with a low, non-damaging, and
   reproducible pressure on the fiber. To validate the method, spectra have
   been recorded as a function of the angle theta between the fiber axis
   and the polarization of the incident radiation. The data have been
   fitted following the cosine square dependency of the absorbance with
   respect to the angle theta. The procedure has been applied to the
   spectral components of the amide I bands, as determined from spectral
   decomposition. Multiple angle measurements turn out to be quite useful
   to correct systematic angle errors and validate the accuracy or the
   curve-fitting parameters of the band decomposition. By using the
   calculated dichroic ratio, a parameter < P-2 > of -0.46 +/- 0.01 has
   been calculated for the antiparallel beta-sheets and -0.04 +/- 0.02 for
   the remaining structures. From the orientation-insensitive spectrum
   A(0), the amount of beta-sheets has been estimated to 49 +/- 3\%. The
   results obtained from only two measurements with the electric field of
   the incident radiation parallel and perpendicular to the fiber axis has
   demonstrated that ATR spectroscopy can be used routinely in quantitative
   studies of the molecular orientation and conformation of macromolecules.}},

Abstract = {{Full DNA profiles can be generated from just a few cells; however these
   profiles can be contaminated from other cell types present at the crime
   scene. We report here on the development of an immunofluorescent
   technique to spatially locate human-specific blood in situ and also on
   the ability of this technique to detect individual leukocytes and the
   DNA contained within them. Four monoclonal Mouse anti-human antibodies
   were evaluated; anti-glycophorin A to detect erythrocytes and anti-CD45,
   anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) and anti-histone H1 to detect the nucleated
   leukocytes. Each antibody was labeled with either Alexa Fluor 488 or 568
   for direct application to blood smears which allowed the Simultaneous
   detection of erythrocytes and leukocytes. Furthermore, because histories
   are DNA binding proteins, the application of anti-histone H1 allowed the
   detection of DNA within a blood smear. Importantly it was found that
   full DNA profiles could be achieved after using this method with similar
   peak area ratios compared to untreated cells. The fluorescent antibodies
   were found to be human-specific with the exception of anti-histone H1
   due to its conserved sequence. However, used in combination with
   anti-CD45 or anti-MPO the location of DNA from human-specific leukocytes
   could be detected. The technique was also tested on older blood stains
   and was still found to be sensitive and cell-specific after 4 months.
   Following the optimization of the methodology, the fluorescent
   antibodies were applied to short lengths of black cotton fibres covered
   with human blood spots. Although the background fluorescence from the
   cotton was found to be high, erythrocytes and even individual leukocytes
   could easily be detected, indicating that this technique could be used
   to detect extremely minute amounts of blood. Used in combination with
   laser capture microdissection (LCM), this method could be used to pick
   off individual leukocytes for LCN DNA techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An examination protocol for rapid detection of remnants of blood
   particles on garments of suspects in bloody murder cases is described.
   Microparticles of blood are sampled along with fibres and hairs using
   the tape lifting method. The tapings are searched with a low power
   microscope for red particles with morphology similar to blood. Presumed
   blood traces are further examined using microspectrophotometry on the
   Cut Out piece of taping. The typical visible spectrum of haemoglobin is
   characteristic for blood. Alternatively Raman spectroscopy can be used
   to measure the characteristic vibrational spectrum of haemoglobin. At a
   later stage, these particles may be removed from the piece of taping in
   order to extract the blood and attempt to obtain a genetic profile. (C)

Abstract = {{The analysis of diketodipyrrole and 2,5-diketopiperazines, detected as
   pyrolysis products from collagen, which is a main component of natural
   leathers, by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS),
   was examined for the development of a forensic identification method of
   small bits of the natural leathers used in this study. Natural leather
   samples (very small pieces) from the five kinds of animals, such as cow,
   pig, sheep, kangaroo, and ostrich, collagen from calf-skin, collagen
   powder from pig-skin, wool fibers, and silk fibers were used as samples.
   The results of Py-GCMS analysis showed that natural leather samples from
   five kinds of animals were composed of collagen, which was distinguished
   from the other protein fibers, such as a wool fiber and a silk fiber.
   The discrimination of the leather samples from five kinds of animals was
   difficult. However, if a leather samples with a weight of more than
   approximately 25 mu g existed as a sample, the Py-GCMS analysis examined
   in this study could detect a diketodipyrrole and 2,5-diketopiperazines
   corresponding to dipeptides, which were composed of major amino acids,
   such as glycine (Gly), proline (Pro), alanine (Ala), and hydroxyproline
   (Hyp) from collagen. Accordingly, the analytical method by Py-GCMS shown
   in this study can be newly applied to the forensic identification of
   small samples of natural leathers.}},

Abstract = {{Research into fingermark enhancement techniques has traditionally used
   visual comparisons and qualitative methods to assess their effectiveness
   based on the quality of the developed fingermark. However, with
   increasing research into the optimisation of these techniques the need
   for a quantitative evaluative method has arisen. Parameters for
   acceptable fingerprint quality are not well defined and generally
   encompass clear, sharp edges and high levels of contrast between the
   fingermark ridges and background material. Using these current
   parameters, a conclusive measurement of fingerprint quality and thus the
   effectiveness of development techniques cannot be achieved.
   This study presents a model through which an aspect of fingerprint
   quality can be objectively and impartially measured based on a relative
   contrast index, constructed through measuring the reflective intensity
   of the fingermark ridges against the background material. Using a
   fibre-optic spectrophotometer attached to a microscope with axial
   illumination, the intensity counts of the ridge detail and background
   material were measured and a logarithmic contrast index constructed. The
   microscope and spectrophotometer parameters were experimentally tested
   using a standard colour resolution chart with known reflective
   properties. The protocol was successfully applied to four sample groups:
   black inked fingerprints on white paper; latent fingermarks on white
   paper developed separately with ninhydrin and physical developer; and
   fingermarks in blood deposited on white tiles and enhanced with amido
   black. The contrast indices obtained quantitatively reflect the level of
   contrast and provide an indication of fingerprint quality through a
   numerical representation rather than previous qualitative methods. It
   has been suggested that the proposed method of fingerprint
   quantification may be viable for application in the forensic research
   arena as it allows the definitive measurement of contrast to aid the
   evaluation of fingermark detection and enhancement techniques. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{This study describes the application of confocal Raman microscopy to the
   detection and identification of drugs-of-abuse in situ on undyed natural
   synthetic fibres, and coloured textile specimens. Raman spectra were
   obtained from drug particles trapped between the fibres of the
   specimens. Pure samples of cocaine hydrochloride and
   N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxy-amphetamine HCl (MDMA-HCl) were used in this
   study Raman spectra were collected from drug particles of an average
   size in the range 5-15 mu m. Despite the presence of spectral bands
   arising from the natural and synthetic polymer and dyed textiles, the
   drugs could be identified by their characteristic Raman bands. If
   necessary, interfering bands could be successfully removed by spectral
   subtraction. Furthermore, Raman spectra were recorded from drug
   particles trapped between the fibres of highly fluorescent specimens.
   Interference from the fibres, including background fluorescence, was
   overcome by careful focusing of the confocal beam and the resulting
   spectra allow ready differentiation from interference from the fibres
   substrate bands. Spectra of several drugs-of-abuse on dyed and undyed
   clothing substrates were readily obtained within 3 min with little or no
   sample preparation and with no alteration of the evidential material.

Abstract = {{This study is conceived as the second part of an experimental analysis
   and focused on the performance of tapered highway light poles under

   investigation for the definition of the most plausible collapse cause
   for aluminum-alloy highway light poles during a wind and winter storm.
   The comparison of the performances is based on frequency and damping
   ratios corresponding to first- and second-mode vibration. Experimental
   testing is employed to derive the dynamic characteristics of the units;
   moreover, the behavior of a damping device, previously proposed for
   mitigation of vulnerable units, is analyzed. Previous results, derived
   for a limited set of cases, are extended in this study to other
   configurations, including different materials and geometry. Discussion
   on the derivation of frequency and damping in the presence of closely
   spaced modes, typical of these systems, is provided. In particular, the
   effectiveness of several methods for the identification of such
   quantities is carefully compared. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   suggests that different operators may acquire prints of differing

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Lens crystallines are special proteins in the eye lens. Because the
   epithelial basement membrane (lens capsule) completely encloses the
   lens, desquamation of aging cells is impossible, and due to the complete
   absence of blood vessels or transport of metabolites in this area, there
   is no subsequent remodelling of these fibers, nor removal of degraded
   lens fibers. Human tissue ultimately derives its C-14 content from the
   atmospheric carbon dioxide. The C-14 content of the lens proteins thus
   reflects the atmospheric content of C-14 when the lens crystallines were
   formed. Precise radiocarbon dating is made possible by comparing the
   C-14 content of the lens crystallines to the so-called bomb pulse, i.e.
   a plot of the atmospheric C-14 content since the Second World War, when
   there was a significant increase due to nuclear-bomb testing. Since the
   change in concentration is significant even on a yearly basis this
   allows very accurate dating. Methodology/Principal Findings. Our results
   allow us to conclude that the crystalline formation in the lens nucleus
   almost entirely takes place around the time of birth, with a very small,
   and decreasing, continuous formation throughout life. The close
   relationship may be further expressed as a mathematical model, which
   takes into account the timing of the crystalline formation.
   Conclusions/Significance. Such a lifelong permanence of human tissue has
   hitherto only been described for dental enamel. In confront to dental
   enamel it must be held in mind that the eye lens is a soft structure,
   subjected to almost continuous deformation, due to lens accommodation,
   yet its most important constituent, the lens crystalline, is never
   subject to turnover or remodelling once formed. The determination of the
   C-14 content of various tissues may be used to assess turnover rates and
   degree of substitution (for example for brain cell DNA). Potential
   targets may be nervous tissues in terms of senile or pre-senile
   degradation, as well as other highly specialised structures of the eyes.
   The precision with which the year of birth may be calculated points to
   forensic uses of this technique.}},

Abstract = {{In an extended introduction, key aspects of resonance Raman spectroscopy
   (RRS) such as enhanced sensitivity and selectivity are briefly discussed
   in comparison with normal RS. The analytical potential is outlined. Then
   achievements in different fields of research are highlighted in four
   sections, with emphasis on recent breakthroughs: (1) The use of visible
   RRS for analyzing carotenoids in biological matrices, for pigments and
   dyes as dealt with in art and forensics, and for characterizing carbon
   nanotubes. (2) The use of RRS in the deep UV (excitation below 260 nm)
   in the bioanalytical and life sciences fields, including nucleic acids,
   proteins and protein-drug interactions. Metalloproteins can be studied
   by visible RRS in resonance with their chromophoric absorption. (3)
   Progress in theoretical calculations of RRS excitation profiles and
   enhancement factors, which ultimately might facilitate analytical RRS.
   (4) Instrumental and methodological achievements including fiber-optic
   UV-RRS, coupling of RRS to liquid chromatography and capillary
   electrophoresis. Sensitivities can approach the single-molecule level
   with surface-enhanced RRS or tip-enhanced RRS. Last but not least,
   promising fluorescence background rejection techniques based on
   time-gated detection will be presented. This review ends with a
   concluding section on future expectations for RRS, in particular its
   potential as an analytical technique. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   are usually associated with a benign prognosis, being in many cases
   asymptomatic and found only by chance, their presence has also been
   considered a cause of angina, malignant arrhythmia, myocardial
   infarction and sudden death. They are diagnosed by angiography in vivo
   when systolic compression of a segment of coronary artery that remains
   patent during diastole is observed. Whether or not myocardial bridges
   are benign or of pathological significance is the subject of ongoing
   controversy. Arguments and evidence for and against this phenomenon are
   discussed here, and a potential solution is offered in an attempt to

Abstract = {{The successful investigation and prosecution of crimes require, in most
   cases, the collection, preservation and forensic analysis of evidence.
   Fiber and textile evidence can provide evidence of an association in
   criminal cases. The individual microscopic fibers that comprise the
   variety of textile materials in the world can be transferred from person
   to person and non textile surfaces, indicating what environment someone
   has been in. It is the job of the forensic fiber examiner to be familiar
   with all of the different types of fibers on the market and to know
   which are most commonly used and which are rare. This is often a
   difficult task as the textile market is constantly changing, producing
   new fibers, finishes, colors, shapes etc. This paper deals with aramide
   fibers, as one of the high performance fibers that are not so common in
   crime cases but the appearance of which in textile trace evidences can
   cause problems in forensic fibers identification.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental forensic microscopy investigations are based on the

   an individual and the environments he or she passes through. This
   article describes how environmental forensic microscopy uses procedures
   developed for environmental monitoring, criminal forensics and
   industrial hygiene investigations. It provides key references to the
   interdisciplinary approach used in microscopic investigations. Case
   studies dealing with lead, asbestos, glass fibers and other particulate
   contaminants are used to illustrate how environmental forensic
   microscopy can be very useful in the initial stages of a variety of
   environmental exposure characterization efforts to eliminate some agents
   of concern and to narrow the field of possible sources of exposure.}},

Abstract = {{A molecularly imprinted organically modified silica was prepared through

   IF, measured as the ratio between phenobarbital peak areas in the MIS
   and NIS chromatograms, was estimated as 58. This value is considerably
   higher than those usually found for conventional methacrylate-based
   molecularly imprinted sorbents and suggests that non-specific
   analyte/sorbent interactions are insignificant in the MIS. This material

   trace evidence. For the reason that the elemental composition of
   inorganic anti-microbial agents was expected to be different from that
   of other additives, carbon-coated fiber samples were analyzed by
   SEM/EDX. As a result, Ag, Ti, P, Zr, etc. were detected, and types of
   inorganic anti-microbial agents in fiber samples could be estimated. The
   elemental result and distribution status of anti-microbial agents in

Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by a recent involvement of the author in a
   forensic investigation on the response of cantilever tubular highway
   poles during a particular winter storm and, in general, unforeseen and
   extreme wind events. These can be classified as situations in which the
   reference wind velocity is clearly below the design value but the
   characterization of the aerodynamic forces challenged by either the
   presence of an adverse weather condition (deposit of freezing
   precipitation) or the eccentric loading transferred to the main system
   through non-structural elements (e.g., luminaire installed at the top of
   the unit). In particular, a set of wind-induced failures of
   aluminum-alloy highway light poles in a central region of the United
   States during a particular event was the original motivation for this
   study. The dynamic performance of these systems was analyzed and
   extended beyond the original scope of the previous investigations to
   account for the unexpected nature of the loading. Statistical
   simulations were employed for the interpretation of the results in terms
   of failure risk. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{An analytical protocol for forensic identification of chemical warfare
   agent surrogates in various sample media is developed. This protocol can
   be implemented on site or in a mobile laboratory, based on a quick
   sample extraction procedure and a subsequent gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. The surrogates in this work include
   2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP),
   2-(butylamino) ethanethiol (BAET), pinacolyl methyl phosphonate (PMP),
   and diethyl phosphoramidate (DEPA) that are simulants of mustard gas,
   sarin, VX (O-Ethyl S-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonothiolate),
   soman, and tabun, respectively. The target analytes in headspace or air
   sample are sampled by the solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers and
   all surrogates are easily detected by GC/MS analysis. The neat vapor is
   also directly analyzed by a portable MS through a membrane inlet but
   only the more volatile CEES and DMMP are detectable and correctly
   identified. The stability of surrogates in acetone is monitored in the
   preparation of standard solution. All surrogates are relatively stable
   in acetone with the exception of BAET, which is found to degrade quickly
   in water and other organic solvents (e.g., acetone, methanol, ethanol,
   hexane). Extraction of water and soil samples is also investigated in
   this study. In analyzing water sample spiked with the surrogates, it is
   found that SPME does not offer any advantage over direct aqueous
   injection into the GC/MS. CEES readily hydrolyzes in water to form
   2-(ethylthio)-ethanol. Soil samples are extracted by acetone and the raw
   extracts are analyzed without any concentration, and all surrogates are
   detectable at 5-10 ppm level for CEES, DMMP, and DEPA. An actual case
   study is carried out using SPME to detect the presence of surrogate
   vapor inside a laboratory refrigerator in which they are stored.}},

Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1227-1233}},

Abstract = {{Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) is a primary myocardial disease
   of unknown cause characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement with
   impaired contractile function. In familial forms of IDCM, mutations of
   genes coding for cytoskeletal proteins related to force transmission,
   such as dystrophin, cardiac actin, desmin, and delta-sarcoglycan, have
   been identified. Here, we report the data of a retrospective
   investigation carried out to evaluate the expression of atrial
   natriuretic peptide (ANP), CD34, troponin T and nestin in the myocardium
   of patients affected with IDCM. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
   consecutive tissue sections from the ventricular wall of 10 human normal
   hearts (NH) following forensic autopsy and 22 IDCM (living explanted
   hearts) were studied using primary monoclonal antibodies against ANP,
   CD34, troponin T and nestin by immunohistochemistry. Myocardial fibers
   were counted independently by three pathologists. Statistics included
   analysis of variance, log-rank test for Kaplan-Meier analysis, and kappa
   assessment for intra- and inter-observer variability. ANP and CD34 were
   significantly overexpressed in IDCM compared to NH (p < 0.05).
   Conversely, troponin T and nestin expression levels did not show
   significant variation. Inter-observer kappa statistics showed a value of
   0.87 and intra-observer kappa statistics a value of 0.98. Evaluation of
   the marker distribution in the myocardium of patients with IDCM CD34
   expression curve was similar to that of troponin T (p < 0.0001),
   although two groups could be identified. Patients with a difference of
   more than 20 myocardial fibers in expression of CD34 and troponin T had
   a somewhat less favorable survival although the difference was not
   significant. The analysis of cells positive for troponin T resulted in a
   similar number of cardiac fibers between NH and IDCM. This is in
   agreement with cardiac enlargement present in IDCM, which is due to
   ventricular dilatation rather than increased number of myocytes.
   Moreover, the expression of nestin, a marker of activation of myocardial
   precursors, did not change either, and this may confirm that there are
   no hyperplastic phenomena in the IDCM pathogenesis. The increase in
   ANP-positive cells in IDCM could be a consequence of neurohormonal
   activation due to a decline in the impaired myocyte contractility.
   Furthermore, since it was already shown that ANP could be important in
   the control of vascular remodeling, we postulated that the increase in
   CD34-positive cells might be functionally correlated with the increase
   in ANP production. Differential expression of CD34 and troponin T might
   be used in future studies to evaluate their prognostic value.}},

Abstract = {{Different ink-jet printed paper materials were investigated using X-ray

   identified by means of a lower ratio of the O and C atomic
   concentrations and lower concentrations in specific trace elements like

   allowed a detailed determination of the chemical state of the respective
   elements. On the basis of a detailed deconvolution of these XPS signals,
   significant differences between all the investigated ink-jet printed

Abstract = {{Background Hair is degraded by the action of both dermatophytic and
   nondermatophytic microorganisms. The importance of understanding hair
   sample condition in archaeological and forensic investigation highlights
   the need for a detailed knowledge of the sequence of degradation in
   samples that have been either buried or left exposed at the ground
   surface.
   Objectives To investigate the sequence of biodegradative change to human
   terminal scalp hair from archaeological and forensic contexts.
   Methods Cut modern scalp hair from three individuals with caucasoid-
   type hair was inoculated with soil microorganisms through soil burial in
   the field and under laboratory conditions to produce experimentally
   degraded samples. The degraded hair fibres were subjected to detailed
   histological examination using a combination of high- resolution light
   microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy to investigate the nature and sequence of degradative change
   to hair structural components.
   Results / discussion Degradation was found to occur first within the
   least structurally robust components that afford the least resistance to
   microbial / chemical attack. The sequence of degradation ( most to
   least- reflecting degree of vulnerability) in the hair cuticle was as
   follows: ( 1) intercellular d- layer ( cell membrane complex); ( 2)
   endocuticle; ( 3) cell membrane b- layers; ( 4) exocuticle; ( 5)
   epicuticle; and ( 6) A- layer. In the hair cortex this was as follows: (
   I) intercellular d- layer ( cell membrane complex); ( II) cell membrane
   b- layers; ( III) intermacrofibrillar matrix / nuclear remnants; ( IV)
   microfibrils; ( V) intermicrofibrillar matrix; and ( VI) pigment
   granules ( the hair fibre component that was the least vulnerable to
   degradation).
   Conclusions The selective progress of degradation in the hair shaft has
   been charted and this provides a basis for further histological work in
   better understanding the condition of hair fibres derived from
   archaeological or forensic contexts as well as being relevant to
   investigation of diseased hair, in particular hair infected by
   dermatophytes and hair weakened by genetic hair shaft abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of blue and red cotton fibres were examined using light and
   fluorescence microscopy as well as UV/VIS microspectrophotometry and
   fluorescence microspectroscopy. The degree of fluorescence and spectral
   variation was recorded. Particular attention was paid to the recurrence
   of certain spectral patterns. The importance of spectral information in
   the UV range is emphasized again. Colour plays a critical role in the
   comparison of cotton fibres in forensic sciences. Normally, fibres
   producing spectral patterns that are frequently seen will tend to have a
   lower evidential value in criminal cases as the choice of putative
   sources is theoretically greater and vice versa. Besides black cotton,
   blue and red cotton fibres are very frequent in fibre casework. The very
   high discriminating power using a combination of light microscopy,
   fluorescence microscopy and UV/VIS microspectrophotometry shows that
   even blue and red cotton fibres can provide excellent evidence when
   involved in fibre transfer cases. (c) 2007 Forensic Science Society.

Abstract = {{Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a miniaturized and solvent-free
   sample preparation technique for chromatographic-spectrometric analysis
   by which the analytes are extracted from a gaseous or liquid sample by
   absorption in, or adsorption on, a thin polymer coating fixed to the
   solid surface of a fiber, inside an injection needle or inside a
   capillary. In this paper, the present state of practical performance and
   of applications of SPME to the analysis of blood, urine, oral fluid and
   hair in clinical and forensic toxicology is reviewed. The commercial
   coatings for fibers or needles have not essentially changed for many
   years, but there are interesting laboratory developments, such as
   conductive polypyrrole coatings for electrochemically controlled SPME of
   anions or cations and coatings with restricted-access properties for
   direct extraction from whole blood or immunoaffinity SPME. In-tube SPME
   uses segments of commercial gas chromatography (GC) capillaries for
   highly efficient extraction by repeated aspiration-ejection cycles of
   the liquid sample. It can be easily automated in combination with liquid
   chromatography but, as it is very sensitive to capillary plugging, it
   requires completely homogeneous liquid samples. In contrast, fiber-based
   SPME has not yet been performed automatically in combination with
   high-performance liquid chromatography. The headspace extractions on
   fibers or needles (solid-phase dynamic extraction) combined with GC
   methods are the most advantageous versions of SPME because of very pure
   extracts and the availability of automatic samplers. Surprisingly,
   substances with quite high boiling points, such as tricyclic
   antidepressants or phenothiazines, can be measured by headspace SPME
   from aqueous samples. The applicability and sensitivity of SPME was
   essentially extended by in-sample or on-fiber derivatization. The
   different modes of SPME were applied to analysis of solvents and
   inhalation narcotics, amphetamines, cocaine and metabolites,
   cannabinoids, methadone and other opioids, fatty acid ethyl esters as
   alcohol markers, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, benzodiazepines, various
   other therapeutic drugs, pesticides, chemical warfare agents, cyanide,
   sulfide and metal ions. In general, SPME is routinely used in optimized
   methods for specific analytes. However, it was shown that it also has
   some capacity for a general screening by direct immersion into urine
   samples and for pesticides and other semivolatile substance in the
   headspace mode.}},

Abstract = {{As skin particles are often deposited by even a single skin contact, the
   detection of skin debris is important for evidence collection and DNA
   testing. Unfortunately, even when a dissecting microscope is used by an
   experienced examiner, epidermal particles are often hard to find and
   these traces of evidence might escape DNA analysis. Fluorescence is
   defined as the property of absorbing short-wavelength light and emitting
   longer-wavelength light. By virtue of the fluorescence characteristics
   of many target materials, tunable light sources assist in the
   macroscopic search of crime scenes and items. We combined the dissecting
   microscope and an alternate light source to examine the fluorescence
   characteristics of skin and skin particles. In a comparative study,
   small skin scales were hidden between sand, fibers, and soil probes, and
   it proved possible to search more successfully with less time and
   effort. On staged casework exhibits, the efficiency of the screening aid
   was again tested and the usability of the new procedure shown.}},

Abstract = {{Accounts of powerful new forensic technologies such as DNA typing, data
   mining, biometric scanning, and electronic location tracking fill the
   daily news. Proponents praise these techniques for helping to exonerate
   those wrongly accused, and for exposing the failings of a criminal
   justice system that previously relied too readily upon faulty forensic
   evidence like handwriting, ballistics, and hair and fiber analysis.
   Advocates applaud the introduction of a `' new paradigm `' for forensic
   evidence, and proclaim that these new techniques will revolutionize how
   the government investigates and tries criminal cases. While the new
   forensic sciences undoubtedly offer an unprecedented degree of certainty
   and reliability, these characteristics alone do not necessarily render
   them less susceptible to misuse. In fact, as this Article argues, the
   most lauded attributes Of these new forms of forensic evidence may
   actually exacerbate the conditions that first caused traditional
   forensic sciences to fall into disrepute.
   This Article challenges the new orthodoxy of forensic science. In so
   doing, it reframes the debate about the role of forensic evidence in the
   criminal justice system in three respects. First, this Article sets
   forth a new taxonomy of forensic evidence that distinguishes first from
   second generation forensic sciences. Second, using this framework, this
   Article illustrates how the particular characteristics of the second
   generation aggravate, rather than relieve, the pathologies that
   ultimately afflicted the first generation. Lastly, this Article
   criticizes current suggestions for improving the use of forensic
   evidence in the criminal justice system that fail to account for the
   peculiar characteristics of the second generation, and advocates
   alternative remedies tailored to these specific concerns.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE \& JUSTICE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{A range of fibre samples was measured using J\&M MSP400 and J\&M MSP800
   microspectrophotometers across the visible and UV/visible wavelength
   ranges respectively. The first derivative of the absorbance spectra was
   then calculated and studied. When the absorbance spectra produced for
   some samples were broad and featureless, the first derivative spectra
   provided more points of comparison that facilitated discrimination. For
   many of the samples, calculating the first derivative did not result in
   any additional discrimination due to the high number of points of
   comparison present in the absorbance spectra. However, for the samples
   that exhibited a high level of intra-sample colour variation (e.g.
   through uneven dye uptake common in cotton and wool, etc.), which was
   evident in the absorbance spectra, the associated first derivative
   spectra highlighted this variation between the fibres and could
   potentially have resulted in false exclusions. The results show that
   whilst calculating first detivative can be a useful aid in the
   comparison of spectra, a high degree of caution is required when
   applying this method to fibres which exhibit a large intra-sample

Abstract = {{This paper discusses techniques that are used to determine the
   underlying causes of fiber rope failures. Rope failures can exhibit a
   complex mixture of features that are sometimes difficult to interpret
   and understand. It is necessary to distinguish between those features
   which occurred during or after a failure from those that may have caused
   or contributed to it and this requires both judgement and experience.
   An investigation always starts with a visual examination and preliminary
   unravelling of the fail zones of the rope. Selective tensile testing is
   then used to generate data that can be used to estimate the rope
   strength at the time of fail. If necessary, further techniques such as
   optical and scanning electron microscopy are used to provide additional
   information for a more detailed understanding of a failure.
   Thermal stability and UV resistance may also have to be assessed when
   investigating failures of certain types of rope and techniques for doing
   these investigations are also described.
   As with any type of forensic investigation, the objective must be to
   gather as much information as possible, from as many different
   perspectives as possible, to permit the correct conclusion to be drawn
   as to the cause or causes of any rope failure.
   Examples from several fiber rope failure investigations are discussed in
   the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Due to degradation in archaeological contexts of eastern North America,
   the few textiles that have been recovered are discolored brown or black;
   some are green due to mineralization. The original coloration goes
   unrecognized. A protocol was developed to classify colorants used in
   these materials that is minimally destructive, and includes forensic
   photography, optical microscopy of strategically sampled fibers,
   scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. Because
   ultraviolet reflected/fluorescent and infrared photography capture
   differences in chemical composition that cannot necessarily be seen by
   the unaided eye, purposive sampling is facilitated. Observed under the
   optical microscope, thoroughly saturated color in the fibers is
   indicative of dyeing in comparison to surface deposited pigment.
   Elemental composition of fibers and surface particulate can be
   correlated to potential mineral or organic colorant sources, as well as
   reflects fiber mineralization.}},

Pages = {{387-402}},
Abstract = {{The single fibre pull-out (SFPO) test has been used to investigate the
   interfacial interaction between a glass fibre and a polyester matrix
   system. However, mechanical data alone cannot explain fully the
   mechanisms of failure, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass
   spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) has been utilised to gain insight into the
   interfacial chemistry of adhesion.
   The present work employs ToF-SIMS imaging for the forensic examination
   of fibre surfaces following a SFPO test. Regions of interest have been
   selected for retrospective spectral analysis. Principle component
   analysis (PCA) has been utilised to assist the identification of regions
   of chemical similarity, enabling better image segmentation and the
   removal of topographic effects.
   Results are presented which lead to the description of a failure model
   based upon these complementary analytical techniques. ToF-SIMS has
   revealed a difference in the surface chemistry at the fibre tip compared
   to the bulk of the pulled-out region, which correlates with finite
   element models in the literature that show higher stress states existing
   at the embedded fibre tip region.}},

Abstract = {{The latest development in IR-fibre optics enables us to expand the
   spectral range of process spectroscopy from 2 mu m out to 17 mu m (5000
   to 600cm-1) i.e. into the most informative ``finger-print{''} part of
   the spectrum. Mid-IR wavelength ranges from 2 to 6-10 mu m may be
   covered by Chalcogenide IR-glass CIR-fibres while Polycrystalline
   PIR-fibres made of Silver Halides solid solutions transmit 4-17 pin
   wavelength radiation.
   PIR-fibre immersion ATR probes and Transmission/Reflection probes had
   been manufactured and successfully tested with different FTIR
   spectrometers in the field of remote spectroscopy for forensic
   substances identification, chemical reaction control, and monitoring of
   exhaust or exhalation gases. Using these techniques no sample
   preparation is necessary for fibre probes to measure evanescent,
   reflection and transmission spectra, in situ and in real time. QCL
   spectrometer may be used as a portable device for multispectral gas
   analysis at 1ppb level of detectivity for various applications in

Abstract = {{We wish to describe further developments to a method previously reported
   on the detection of 2-phenoxyethanol in ink. The solid-phase
   microextraction (SPME) sampling technique, together with gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), has been used to quantify
   solvents in writing ink. In conventional approaches, the analysis of ink
   on documents requires some degree of destructive sampling. The methods
   commonly used remove ink samples from paper using a scalpel or a paper
   punch. To avoid document destruction, a sampling cell was constructed
   that allows solvents to be adsorbed directly onto the SPME fiber from
   the headspace above the document surface. Analytes (ink volatiles) are
   then desorbed from the SPME fiber on a gas chromatograph equipped with a
   mass selective detector (GC-MSD). With this method, it was possible to
   detect the presence of ink solvents on documents for a period lasting up
   to c. 2 years.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to determine the age of a bruise of unknown age mechanism is
   important in matters of domestic and child abuse and forensics. While
   physicians are asked to make clinical judgment on the age of a bruise
   using color and tenderness, studies have shown that a physicians
   estimate is highly inaccurate and in cases no better than chance alone.
   We present here the temporal progression of reflection spectrum
   collected from accidentally inflicted contusions in adult and child
   study participants with a synopsis of the observed phenomena. Reflection
   spectra collected using a portable fiber optic reflection spectrometer
   can track the increase in extravasated hemoglobin from trauma caused
   blood vessel rupture and subsequent removal of this hemoglobin occurring
   concurrent with an increase in the absorption attributed to the
   breakdown product bilirubin. We hypothesize that this time dependent
   pattern can be used to determine the age of an unknown bruise in an
   individual provided rate constant information for the patient can be
   determined in a controlled calibration bruise. Using reflection spectra
   to estimate bruise age can provide a rapid and noninvasive method to
   improve the ability of physicians in dating the age of a contusion.}},

Abstract = {{The forensic community utilises a myriad of techniques to investigate a
   wide range of materials, from paint flakes to DNA. The various
   microscopic techniques have provided some of the greatest contributions,
   e. g., FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared) microspectroscopy utilised in
   copy toner discrimination, multi-layer automobile paint fragment
   examination, etc, SEM-EDA (scanning electron microscopy with energy
   dispersive analysis) used to investigate glass fragments, fibers, and
   explosives, and SEM in microsampling for elemental analysis, just to
   name a few.
   This study demonstrates the ability of the Scanning Probe Microscope
   (SPM) to analyse human fingerprints on surfaces utilising a
   step-and-scan feature, enabling analysis of a larger field-of-view. We
   also extend a line crossings study by incorporating height analysis and
   surface roughness measurements. The study demonstrates the potential for
   SPM techniques to be utilised for forensic analysis which could
   complement the more traditional methodologies used in such

Abstract = {{Almost nine years ago, a laboratory research program and field program
   were initiated to determine whether composite wrapping could be used as
   a means of rehabilitating corrosion-damaged structures. In the
   laboratory program, more than 60 cylindrical and rectangular specimens
   were designed to simulate bridge columns and beams. Some of the
   specimens were damaged, repaired and wrapped with composite materials,
   and then exposed to salt-containing environments. The composite systems
   used included a vinyl ester resin and two epoxy resins in combination
   with selected fabrics containing glass fibers. Variables included type
   of repair material, type of composite wrapping system, length of wrap,
   presence or absence of cracks, and presence or absence of pre-existing
   chlorides. Two years into the investigation, another set of 17
   cylindrical specimens was cast and added to the investigation to examine
   the effect of spray-on or migrating corrosion inhibitors. Forensic
   analysis during the past seven years showed that in general, the
   composite wraps helped to minimize corrosion activity in the wrapped
   portions of the specimens, even if cracks and chlorides were initially
   present.}},

Abstract = {{Desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) was
   recently reported for the direct analysis of sample media without the

   analysis of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers by DESI-MS/MS was
   evaluated with indoor office media that might be collected during a
   forensic investigation, including wall surfaces, office fabrics, paper
   products and Dacron swabs used for liquid sampling. Media spiked at the
   mu g/g level with purified chemical warfare agents and a complex
   munitions grade sample of tabun, to simulate the quality of chemical
   warfare agent that might be used for terrorist purposes, were
   successfully analysed by DESI-MS/MS. Sulfur mustard, a compound that has
   not been successfully analysed by electrospray mass spectrometry in the
   past, was also sampled using a SPME fiber and analysed for the first
   time by DESI-MS/MS. Finally, the overall analytical approach involving
   SPME headspace sampling and DESI-MS analysis was evaluated during a
   scenario-based training live agent exercise. A sarin sample collected by
   the military was analysed and confirmed by DESI-MS in a mobile

Abstract = {{Non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the separation
   of five hydrophobic basic blue dyes for application in forensic dye
   analysis. The use of a red light emitting diode as a high intensity,
   low-noise light source provided sensitive detection of the blue dyes
   while also allowing the evaluation of solvents that absorb strongly in
   the UV region. Excellent peak shapes and separation selectivity were
   obtained in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide,
   however water, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide and acetone were
   unsuitable as solvents due to poor peak shapes and a lack of
   sensitivity, most likely due to adsorption onto the capillary wall. Due
   to the known compatibility of methanol with capillary
   electrophoresis-mass spectrometry, this solvent was examined further
   with the relative acidity/basicity of the electrolyte being optimised
   with an artificial neural network. The optimised method was examined for
   the separation of ink samples from 6 fibre tip and 2 ball point blue or
   black pens and showed that a unique migration time for the main dye
   component in seven of the eight pens could be obtained. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{A new and simple procedure for the determination of parathion in human
   whole blood and urine using direct immersion (DI) solid-phase
   microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
   is presented. This technique was developed using only 100 mu L of
   sample, and ethion was used as internal standard (IS). A 65-mu m
   Carbowax/divinylbenzene (CW/DVB) SPME fibre was selected for sampling,
   and the main parameters affecting the SPME process such as extraction
   temperature, adsorption and desorption time, salt addition, agitation
   and pH effect were optimized to enhance the sensitivity of the method.
   This optimization was also performed to allow the qualitative
   determination of parathion's main metabolite, paraoxon, in blood. The
   limits of detection and quantitation for parathion were 3 and 10 ng/mL
   for urine and 25 and 50 ng/mL for blood, respectively. For paraoxon, the
   limit of detection was 50 ng/mL in blood. The method showed linearity
   between the LOQ and 50 mu g/mL for both matrices, with correlation
   coefficients ranging from 0.9954 to 0.9999. Precision and accuracy were
   in conformity with the criteria normally accepted in bioanalytical
   method validation. The mean absolute recoveries were 35.1\% for urine
   and 6.7\% for blood. Other parameters such as dilution of sample and
   stability were also validated. Its simplicity and the fact that only 100
   mu L of sample is required to accomplish the analysis make this method
   useful in forensic toxicology laboratories to determine this compound in
   intoxications, and it can be considered an alternative to other methods
   normally used for the determination of this compound in biological
   media.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the Forensic Ear Identification (FearID) research project,
   which aims to obtain estimators for the strength of evidence of earmarks
   found on crime scenes, a large database of earprints (over 1200 donors)
   has been collected. Starting from a knowledge-based approach where
   experts add anatomical annotations of minutiae and landmarks present in
   prints, comparison of pairs of prints is done using the method of Vector
   Template Matching (VTM). As the annotation process is subjective, a
   validation experiment was performed to study its stability. Comparing
   prints on the basis of VTM, it appears that there are interoperator
   effects, individual operators yielding significantly more consistent
   results when annotating prints than different operators. The operators
   being well trained and educated, the observed variation on both clicking
   frequency and choice of annotation points suggests that implementation
   of the above is not the best way to go about objectifying earprint
   comparison. Processes like the above are relevant for any forensic
   science dealing with identification (e.g., of glass, tool marks, fibers,
   faces, fingers, handwriting, speakers) where manual (nonautomated)
   processes play a role. In these cases, results may be operator dependent
   and the dependencies need to be studied.}},

Abstract = {{A 20-year old African woman underwent anesthesia for interruption of an
   unwanted pregnancy. As a consequence of the anesthesia, she went into
   coma because of an as yet unknown and untested homozygotic state of
   sickle cell anemia. Her vital functions were maintained for more than 1
   year by intensive medicine, but she died finally in multiorgan failure
   and aspiration pneumonia. Because of the complications under anesthesia
   and the missing preanesthetic test for hemoglobinopathy, autopsy was
   conducted in the forensic medicine department and not in the department
   of pathology. The sickle cell disease was diagnosed by electrophoresis
   of the blood, by molecular detection of mutation in the hemoglobin gene,
   as well as by postmortem light and electron microscopy. Sickle cells
   were found in capillaries of brain, liver, lung, bone marrow, and
   spleen. Electrophoretic analysis revealed 80.2\% HbS in addition to
   3.2\% HbA(2) and 16.6\% HbF, whereas no HbA(0) could be detected in
   blood, confirming the homozygosity of sickle cell anemia. Because of
   sickle cell crisis, occluded blood vessels, and severe brain cortex
   necrosis, the patient died in spite of reanimation and intensive
   medicine. This case demonstrates that it is still important to realize
   the possibility of this disease and diagnostic obstacles even in regions
   where its manifestation is not endemic, as in Northern and Central
   Europe.}},

Abstract = {{The routine production of a cast of a shoe-print taken in soil provides
   information other than shoe size and gait. Material adhering to the
   surface of the cast represents the preservation of the moment of
   footprint impression. The analysis of the interface between the cast and
   soil is therefore a potentially lucrative source of information for
   forensic reconstruction. These principles are demonstrated with
   reference to a murder case which took place in the English Midlands. The
   cast of a footprint provided evidence of a two-way transfer of material
   between the sole of a boot and the soil of a recently ploughed field.
   Lumps of soil, which had dried on a boot, were deposited on the field as
   the footprints were made. Pollen analysis of these lumps of soil
   indicated that the perpetrator of the imprint had been standing recently
   in a nearby stream. Fibre analysis together with physical and chemical
   characteristics of the soil suggested a provenance for contamination of
   this mud prior to deposition of the footprint. Carbon/nitrogen ratios of
   the water taken from the cast showed that distilled water had been used
   thus excluding the possibility of contamination of the boot-soil
   interface. It was possible to reconstruct three phases of previous
   activity of the wearer of the boot prior to leaving the footprint in the
   field after the murder had taken place. This analysis shows the power of
   integrating different independent techniques in the analysis of hitherto
   unrecognised forensic materials. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The interpretation of fibre evidence requires an assessment of the value
   inherent in the number of matching fibres. In a Bayesian framework the
   probability that a group of x fibres would be present on a garment by
   chance needs to be assessed (Sx). Accordingly, a pilot study of the
   total foreign fibre population on a small number of garments was
   undertaken. The number of coloured fibres found on six white T-shirts
   after each one was worn for one day was counted. The T-shirts were found
   to contain between 9,108 and 13,925 coloured foreign fibres.
   All of the coloured fibres from one of these T-shirts were
   microscopically examined to record their colour, width and length, and
   to classify them as either cotton, wool, synthetic, silk or
   miscellaneous. Pair-wise comparisons of similar fibres were then
   performed to determine the number and size of the groups of foreign
   fibres present on the T-shirt. These results add to the published
   information regarding the background foreign fibre populations on
   clothing and other items. This knowledge should assist the forensic
   fibre analyst when using a Bayesian framework to interpret fibre cases.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and
   microscopy have been widely used in forensic science. New opportunities
   exist to obtain chemical images and to enhance the spatial resolution
   using attenuated total reflection (ATR) FT-IR spectroscopy coupled with
   a focal-plane array (FPA) detector. In this paper, the sensitivity
   limits of FT-IR imaging using three different ATR crystals (Ge, ZnSe,
   and diamond) in three different optical arrangements for the detection
   of model particles is discussed. Model systems of ibuprofen and
   paracetamol particles having sizes below 32 pm were studied. The
   collection of drug particles was achieved with the aid of two different
   tapes: common adhesive tape and a film of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).
   The surface of the film with collected particles was measured directly
   via ATR-FT-IR imaging. Since the removal of tape from porous surfaces
   can be difficult, the application of micro ATR-FT-IR imaging directly to
   the surface of a newspaper contaminated with particles of model drugs is
   also discussed. In order to assess the feasibility of the chosen method
   in a forensic case study, the detection of diacetylmorphine
   hydrochloride traces in PDMS matrix and the finger surface is
   investigated. The scenarios considered were that of the detection of
   evidence collected at a crime scene with the tape lift method and the
   analysis of the finger of an individual after drug handling. The results
   show broad implications in the detection of drugs of abuse.}},

   disperse dye standards. The LC/MS also detected and analyzed dyes
   extracted from individual 0.5 cm acrylic and polyester fibers,
   demonstrating its applicability to this type of analysis. With regard to
   the analysis of disperse dyes in polyester fibers, the replacement of
   pyridine with acetonitrile in the extraction system allowed direct
   injection of the extracts into the LC/MS. The advantage of the LC/MS
   over other instrumental methods of textile dye analysis is demonstrated
   by the analysis and differentiation of three black acrylic fibers: two
   fibers had similar UV-Vis spectra but were differentiated with
   chromatography and two had similar UV-Vis spectra and chromatograms but
   were differentiated using the mass spectrometer.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for thermal desorption of small samples is presented. The
   method uses a solid phase microextraction (SPME) holder with the fiber
   removed. The sample-for example, an ink sample on paper-is simply placed
   inside the needle of the holder, where normally an SPME fiber is
   positioned. The thermal desorption is then performed on any kind of gas
   chromatograph in a manner similar to that for SPME analysis. The needle
   of the SPME holder penetrates the injector septum; the temperature of
   the thermal desorption is simply the temperature of the injector. No
   solvents or liquid nitrogen cooling are used. The paper sample is kept
   inside the holder needle during the analysis. After the analysis is
   completed, the sample is removed from the needle by pushing forward the
   steel wire inside the needle in the way normally used to perform
   sampling with the SPME fiber. The desorbed compounds were analyzed by
   gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector or by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. The optimum temperature for desorption
   of ink samples on paper was 200 degrees C. The influence of the paper
   matrix is negligible at that temperature. Laboratories lacking the
   commercial device for thermal desorption can use this cheap device for
   the analysis of, for example, writing ink, printing ink, and inkjet ink
   samples on paper. Other types of samples can be investigated but the
   size of samples suitable for analysis is limited.}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments were conducted using various types of pollen

   presented in the literature for fibres and glass particulates. The
   experiments presented in this paper were conducted for up to 647 hours
   for individual runs and it was found that a general rule existed that it
   was the material type rather than the particulate type that was the
   major controlling factor in the persistence of particles. For the pollen
   grain experiments the overall theory is sustained; there is a
   significant loss initially followed by a slower decay although this is
   not precise given the varied nature of palynomorph types. The manner by
   which the particulates were introduced onto the material had an initial
   immediate effect, however, the persistence of these particulates over
   longer periods of time was generally unaffected.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decades, the importance of technical and scientific
   evidence for the criminal justice system has been steadily increasing.
   Unfortunately, the weight of forensic evidence is not always easy for
   the trier of fact to assess, as appears from a brief discussion of some
   recent cases in which the weight of expert evidence was either grossly
   over- or understated. Also, in recent years, questions surrounding the
   value of forensic evidence have played a major role in the appeal and
   revision stages of a number of highly publicized criminal cases in
   several countries, including the UK and the Netherlands. Some of the
   present confusion is caused by the different ways in which conclusions
   are formulated by experts working within the traditional approach to
   forensic identification, as exemplified by (1) dactyloscopy and (2) the
   other traditional forensic identification disciplines like handwriting
   analysis, firearms analysis and fibre analysis, as opposed to those
   working within the modern scientific approach used in forensic DNA
   analysis. Though most clearly expressed in the way conclusions are
   formulated within the diverse fields, these differences essentially
   reflect the scientific paradigms underlying the various identification
   disciplines. The types of conclusions typically formulated by
   practitioners of the traditional identification disciplines are seen to
   be directly related to the two major principles underpinning traditional
   identification science, i.e. the uniqueness assumption and the
   individualization principle. The latter of these is shown to be
   particularly problematic, especially when carried to its extreme, as
   embodied in the positivity doctrine, which is almost universally
   embraced by the dactyloscopy profession and allows categorical
   identification only. Apart from issues arising out of the interpretation
   of otherwise valid expert evidence there is growing concern over the
   validity and reliability of the expert evidence submitted to courts.
   While in various countries including the USA, Canada and the Netherlands
   criteria have been introduced which may be used as a form of input or
   output control on expert evidence, in England and Wales expert evidence
   is much less likely to be subject to forms of admissibility or
   reliability testing. Finally, a number of measures are proposed which
   may go some way to address some of the present concerns over the
   evaluation of technical and scientific evidence. (c) 2005 Published by

Abstract = {{A series of experiments was conducted by exposing negative film in brand
   new cameras of different make and model. The exposures were repeated at
   regular time intervals spread over a period of 2 years. The processed
   film negatives were studied under a stereomicroscope (10-40x) in
   transmitted illumination for the presence of the characterizing features
   on their four frame-edges. These features were then related to those
   present on the masking frame of the cameras by examining the latter in
   reflected light stereomicroscopy (10-40x). The purpose of the study was
   to determine the origin and permanence of the frame-edge-marks, and also
   the processes by which the marks may probably alter with time.
   The investigations have arrived at the following conclusions: (i) the
   edge-marks have originated principally from the imperfections received
   on the film mask from the manufacturing and also occasionally from the
   accumulated dirt, dust and fiber on the film mask over an extended time
   period. (ii) The edge profiles of the cameras have remained fixed over a
   considerable period of time so as to be of a valuable identification
   medium. (iii) The marks are found to be varying in nature even with
   those cameras manufactured at similar time. (iv) The influence of
   f/number and object distance has great effect in the recording of the
   frame-edge marks during exposure of the film.
   The above findings would serve as a useful addition to the technique of
   camera edge-mark comparisons. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The application of infrared chemical imaging to the analysis of
   bicomponent fibers was evaluated. Eleven nominally bicomponent fibers
   were examined either side-on or in cross-section. In six of the 11
   samples, infrared chemical imaging was able to spatially resolve two
   spectroscopically distinct regions when the fibers were examined
   side-on. As well as yielding characteristic infrared spectra of each
   component, the technique also provided images that clearly illustrated
   the side-by-side configuration of these components in the fiber. In one
   case it was possible to prepare and image a cross-section of the fiber,
   but in general the preparation of fiber cross-sections proved very
   difficult. In five of the 11 samples, the infrared spectra could be used
   to identify the overall chemical composition of the fibers, according to
   a published classification scheme, but the fiber components could not be
   spatially resolved. Difficulties that are inherent to conventional
   ``single-point{''} infrared spectroscopy, such as interference fringing
   and sloping baselines, particularly when analyzing acrylic type fibers,
   were also encountered in the infrared chemical image analysis of
   bicomponent fibers. A number of infrared sampling techniques were
   investigated to overcome these problems, and recommendations for the
   best sampling technique are given. Chemical imaging results were
   compared with those obtained using conventional fiber microscopy

Abstract = {{Most prior analytical studies have dealt with the determination of
   chemical warfare agents in environmental or biological matrices that
   would typically be collected following battlefield use or in support of
   the Chemical Weapons Convention. These methods may be useful for some
   investigations, but may not be practical for indoor forensic
   investigations where chemical warfare agent use is suspected. There is a
   need for analytical methods for chemical warfare agent identification in
   office media, including flooring, wall surfaces, office fabrics and
   paper products, which would typically be collected in an office
   environment during forensic investigations. During this study, typical
   office environment media were spiked at the 4-20 mu g/g level with
   either a complex munitions grade sample of tabun (GA) or with a standard
   containing the three nerve agents, satin (GB), cyclohexyl
   methylphosphonofluoridate (GF), soman (GD) and the nerve agent simulant,
   triethyl phosphate (TEP), to evaluate the potentials of liquid
   chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and
   liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-ESI-MS/MS) for forensic purposes. An emerging technique, desorption
   electrospray ionization (DESI-MS/MS), was also investigated for the
   direct determination of TEP, GB and GD sampled onto solid phase
   microextraction (SPME) fibers exposed to spiked office media. The spiked
   chemical warfare agents were recovered with varying efficiencies during
   this study, but in all cases sufficient chemical warfare agent was
   recovered for mass spectrometric identification purposes. Full high
   resolution mass spectra were acquired for all the chemical warfare
   agents in the continuum mode, which typically resulted in mass
   measurement errors of 0.001 Da or less. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

   date. Genetic variation was surveyed in three populations of fiber hemp
   and a potent cultivar of marijuana using AFLP markers. Ten primer pairs
   yielded 1206 bands, of which 88\% were polymorphic. Eighteen bands
   represented fixed differences between all fiber populations and the drug
   cultivar. These markers have practical utility for (1) establishing
   conspiracy in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana, (2)
   identifying geographic sources of seized drugs, and (3) discriminating
   illegal, potent marijuana cultivars from hemp where the cultivation of
   industrial hemp is permitted.}},

Abstract = {{The key role of a forensic scientist is to assist in determining whether
   a crime has been committed, and if so, assist in the identification of
   the offender. Many people hold the belief that a particular item can be
   conclusively linked to a specific person, place or object.
   Unfortunately, this is often not achievable in forensic science. In
   performing their role, scientists develop and test hypotheses. The
   significance of those hypotheses that cannot be rejected upon completion
   of all available examinations/analyses is then evaluated.
   Although one can generally identify the substances present using
   available techniques, it is generally not possible to distinguish one
   source of the same substance from another. In such circumstances,
   although a particular hypothesis cannot be rejected, it cannot be
   conclusively proven, i.e. the samples could still have originated from
   different sources.
   This limitation of not being able to distinguish between sources
   currently extends to the analysis of other forensic samples including,
   but not limited to, ignitable liquids, paints, adhesives, textile
   fibres, plastics, and illicit drugs.
   Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is an additional technique
   that can be utilised to test a given hypothesis. This technique shows
   the potential to be able to individualise a range of materials of
   forensic interest.
   This paper provides a brief description of the technique, followed by a
   review of the various applications of IRMS in different scientific
   fields. The focus of this summary is on forensic applications of IRMS,
   in particular the analysis of explosives, ignitable liquids and illicit
   drugs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is proposed as a suitable
   technique for the differentiation of colorless polyacrylonitrile-based
   fibers with similar morphology. Quite frequently, a comparison between
   items of this type is necessary to assess the reliability of the
   reconstruction of a crime. Hydrocyanic acid, acetonitrile,
   acrylonitrile, acetic acid, methacrylonitrile, 1,3-dicyanopropene,
   1,3-dicyanobutene, 2,4-dicyanobutene and 1,3,5-tricyanohexane were the
   degradation products deemed most useful for discrimination of the
   samples. Principal component analysis was employed for pattern
   recognition. Although fibers are industrial products very similar in
   structure and properties, the concentration and the distribution of
   head-to-head arrangements of the monomers differ slightly. These
   structural defects alter in a significant way the composition of the
   mixture of the pyrolysis products. This allows for the differentiation
   of fibers, which are often important traces in criminal investigations.

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the effects of ischemia on the myocardial
   fibers and the expression of the transcriptional factor for angiogenesis
   hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in human heart specimens.
   We have prospectively analyzed the HIF-1 alpha expression in human
   ischemic hearts with the ABC-inmunohistochemistry technique and
   amplification by biotinylated tyramide. The relationship between the
   expression of HIF-1 alpha and the temporal evolution of ischemia has
   also been evaluated. As pathomorphological diagnosis of early myocardial
   ischemia has many problems in human autopsy material with less than 4 to
   6 h after clinical onset, we suggest that HIF-1 alpha is helpful in the
   early acute myocardial infarction diagnosis, so it stains necrotic areas
   within the first 2 h. The amplification procedure provides a higher
   intensity of the final staining without losing specificity. It is
   concluded that in normal cardiac fibers, basal expression of HIF-1 alpha
   is not appreciable, but it steadily increases after ischemia. With
   regard to the practical applicability in forensic field, our
   observations suggest that positive immunohistochemical expression of
   HIF-1 alpha on heart samples may be used as a reliable indicator of
   myocardial damage in cases without cardiac lesion evidence, using
   conventional microscopy. This method is especially useful and may
   provide definitive proof of myocardial ischemia in unexpected deaths
   without previous symptoms, or in forensic cases with a short period of
   clinical manifestations. In addition, it may have been involved in
   possible future cardiovascular therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional FTIR spectroscopy and microscopy has been widely used in
   forensic science. New opportunities exist to obtain rapid chemical
   images and to enhance the sensitivity of detection of trace materials
   using attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with a focal-plane array (FPA) detector. In
   this work, the sensitivity of ATR-FTIR spectroscopic imaging using three
   different kinds of ATR crystals (Ge coupled with an infrared microscope,
   ZnSe and diamond) and resulting in three different optical arrangements
   for the detection of model drug particles is discussed. Model systems of
   ibuprofen and paracetamol particles having a size below 32 micrometers
   have been prepared by sieving. The sensitivity level in the three
   different approaches has been compared and it has been found that both
   micro and macro-ATR imaging methods have proven to be a promising
   techniques for the identification of concealed drug particles. To
   demonstrate the power and applicability of FTIR chemical imaging to
   forensic research, various examples are discussed. This includes
   investigation of the changes of chemical nature of latent fingerprint

Abstract = {{This presentation outlines the research we are developing in the area of
   Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging with the focus
   on materials of forensic interest. FTIR spectroscopic imaging has
   recently emerged as a powerful tool for characterisation of
   heterogeneous materials. FTIR imaging relies on the ability of the
   military-developed infrared array detector to simultaneously measure
   spectra from thousands of different locations in a sample. Recently
   developed application of FTIR imaging using an ATR (Attenuated Total
   Reflection) mode has demonstrated the ability of this method to achieve
   spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit of infrared light in
   air. Chemical visualisation with enhanced spatial resolution in
   micro-ATR mode broadens the range of materials studied with FTIR imaging
   with applications to pharmaceutical formulations or biological samples.
   Macro-ATR imaging has also been developed for chemical imaging analysis
   of large surface area samples and was applied to analyse the surface of
   human skin (e.g. finger), counterfeit tablets, textile materials
   (clothing), etc. This approach demonstrated the ability of this imaging
   method to detect trace materials attached to the surface of the sicin.
   This may also prove as a valuable tool in detection of traces of
   explosives left or trapped on the surfaces of different materials. This
   FTIR imaging method is substantially superior to many of the other
   imaging methods due to inherent chemical specificity of infrared
   spectroscopy and fast acquisition times of this technique. Our
   preliminary data demonstrated that this methodology will provide the
   means to non-destructive detection method that could relate evidence to
   its source. This will be important in a wider crime prevention
   programme. In summary, intrinsic chemical specificity and enhanced
   visualising capability of FTIR spectroscopic imaging open a window of
   opportunities for counter-terrorism and crime-fighting, with
   applications ranging from analysis of trace evidence (e.g. in soil),
   tablets, drugs, fibres, tape explosives, biological samples to detection
   of gunshot residues and imaging of fingerprints.}},

   anaesthetized pig. The fluorescence build-up was measured as a function
   of time, rising a fiber probe setup. Fluorescence measurements proved to
   be a suitable toot for monitoring the temporal distribution of fluid in
   a subcutaneous hemorrhage. Reasonable values for tire fluid velocity was
   obtained by monitoring the fluorescein distribution around the infusion
   point. Further theoretical work and development of the experimental
   technique is necessary to obtain a good understanding of subcutaneous
   transport of blood.}},

Abstract = {{A novel microextraction procedure based on micro-column packed with
   polystyrene electrospun nanofibers as the sorbents was presented as a
   simple, rapid and effective sample pretreatment technique coupled with
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) for analysis of
   papaverine in human plasma. In the extraction procedure, the plasma
   sample was loaded onto the micro-column, and pushed through the column
   bed by a gas tight plastic syringe. The targets were absorbed onto the
   nanofibers. After washing sorbent with water, the analyte was eluted
   with a small aliquot of methanol, which can be directly injected onto
   the assay system. Various factors were considered systematically.
   Parameters such as fiber diameter, packing amount of the naofibers, and
   pH of liquid phase were evaluated. The procedure was validated in terms
   of linearity (gamma=0.999 4 for concentrations ranging from 10 to 5 000
   ng/mL), precision (4.4 and 1.6\%, respectively at 100 and 500 ng/mL),
   sensitivity (5 ng/mL for LOD) and extraction recovery (80.6\%-90.2\%).
   The developed procedure was found suitable for forensic investigations
   and was considered a good alternative to the liquid-liquid extraction
   methods normally used for the determination of this compound in
   biological media.}},

Abstract = {{A new, simple and rapid procedure for the determination of dimethoate in
   urine and blood samples was developed using direct immersion solid-phase
   microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. This technique
   required only 0.1 mL of sample, and ethion was used as internal
   standard. Two types of coated fibre were compared (100 mu m
   polydimethylsiloxane, and 65 mu m Carbowax((TM))/divinylbenzene). Other
   parameters, such as extraction temperature, adsorption and desorption
   time, salt addition, agitation and pH, were optimized to enhance the
   sensitivity of the method. Limits of detection (LODs) and quantitation
   (LOQs) were 50 and 100 ng/mL for urine and 200 and 500 ng/mL for blood,
   respectively. The method was found to be linear between the LOQ and 40
   mu g/mL for urine, and between the LOQ and 50 mu g/mL for blood, with
   correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9923-0.9996. Precision (intra-
   and interday) and accuracy were in conformity with the criteria normally
   accepted in bioanalytical method validation. The mean absolute
   recoveries of dimethoate were 1.24 and 0.50\% for urine and blood,
   respectively. Because of its simplicity and the fact that small volumes
   of sample are used, the described method can be successfully used in the
   diagnosis of poisoning by this pesticide, namely in those situations
   where the sample volume is limited, as frequently occurs in forensic
   toxicology. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is described for the qualitative and quantitative analysis
   of cyanide, a very short-acting and powerful toxic agent, in human whole
   blood. It involves the conversion of cyanide into hydrogen cyanide and
   its subsequent headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and
   detection by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in selected
   ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Optimizing the conditions for the GC/MS (type
   of column, injection conditions, temperature program) and SPME (choice
   of SPME fiber, effect of salts, adsorption and desorption times,
   adsorption temperature) led to the choice of a 75-mu m
   carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane SPME fiber, with D-3-acetonitrile as
   internal standard, and a capillary GC column with a polar stationary
   phase. Method validation was carried out in terms of linearity,
   precision and accuracy in both aqueous solutions and blood. The limit of
   detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were determined only in
   aqueous solutions. The assay is linear over three orders of magnitude
   (water 0.01-10, blood 0.05-10 mu g/mL); and the LOD and LOQ in water
   were 0.006 and 0.01 mu g/mL, respectively. Good intra- and inter-assay
   precision was obtained, always < 8\%. The method is simple, fast and
   sensitive enough for the rapid diagnosis of cyanide intoxication in
   clinical and forensic toxicology. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Gelatin lifter is widely used for recovering shoeprints from crime
   scenes. Dusty shoeprints removed from paper with loose fibers, cloth or

   lifter is applied directly on the surface of the gelatin lifter, and is
   removed instantly. The adhesive lifter removes the upper layer of the
   attached material on the gelatin lifter. After removing the concealing
   material from the hidden imprint, the quality of the visualized imprint
   is improved. The cleaning process can be applied as many times as needed
   and the optimum number is different for each substrate. The small dust
   particles comprising the shoeprint remained attached to the sticky side
   of the gelatin lifter even though the adhesion force applied by the
   adhesive lifter is great. Repeating the procedure too many times could
   harm the quality of the print severely, yet the advantages of this
   method are greater than the risks of relocation of image quality

Abstract = {{Many automobile manufacturers began installing airbags on the driver's
   side in the late 1980's. Passenger side airbags followed in the early
   1990's. Most airbags use a solid-propellant type of material that
   produces a hot gas to inflate the airbags. The gas in the driver side
   airbag leaves the inflator at a temperature as hot as 600 degrees C. The
   hot gas escapes through the vent holes after deployment, but it can also
   leak through the stitching seams in the front and singe a pattern on the
   occupant's clothing characteristic of the seam pattern. The singe
   patterns from the driver and passenger side airbags will be different.
   Cornstarch, which is used as a lubricant in some driver side airbags,
   can transfer to the driver's shirt. Hairs, fibers and make-up can
   transfer from the driver or passenger to the surface of the deployed
   airbags. Two cases are presented, illustrating singe patterns and

Abstract = {{A collaborative study on Raman spectroscopy was carried out by members
   of the ENFSI (European Network of Forensic Science Institutes) European
   Fibres Group (EFG) on three dyed fibers: two red acrylics and one red
   wool. Raman instruments from six different manufacturers were tested as
   well as nine different laser wavelengths ranging from blue (lambda=458
   nm) to near infrared-NIR (lambda= 1064 nm). This represents the largest
   comparison study of Raman analytical parameters carried out on identical
   fiber samples. For the chosen fiber and dye samples, red lasers
   (lambda=633 and 685 nm) gave the poorest spectral quality whereas blue
   (458 nm), green (514 nm) and near infrared lasers (785, 830 and 1064 nm)
   provided average results. Blue (488 nm) and green lasers (532 nm)
   globally gave the best quality spectra. Fluorescence problems were often
   encountered with some of the excitation wavelengths and therefore a
   flexible Raman instrument equipped with different lasers can be
   recommended to measure forensic fiber samples. The instrument should
   also be equipped with a Raman microscope in order to be able to focus on
   a single fiber. This study shows that Raman spectroscopy usually enables
   the identification of the main dye present in a colored fiber; however,
   minor dye components are much more difficult to detect. SERRS (Surface
   Enhanced Resonance Raman Scattering) techniques give an improvement of
   the dye's spectral intensity but no spectral improvement was observed
   for the two red acrylic and red wool fibers tested.}},

Abstract = {{Nylons are an important class of synthetic polymers, from an industrial,
   as well as forensic, perspective. A spectroscopic method, such as
   Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, is necessary to
   determine the nylon subclasses (e.g., nylon 6 or nylon 6,6). Library
   searching using absolute difference and absolute derivative difference
   algorithms gives inconsistent results for identifying nylon subclasses.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of peak ratio
   analysis and multivariate statistics for the identification of nylon
   subclasses using attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectral data. Many
   nylon subclasses could not be distinguished by the peak ratio of the N-H
   vibrational stretch to the sp(3) C-H-2 vibrational stretch intensities.
   Linear discriminant analysis, however, provided a graphical
   visualization of differences between nylon subclasses and was able to
   correctly classify a set of 270 spectra from eight different subclasses
   with 98.5\% cross-validated accuracy. Index Headings: Internal

Abstract = {{Absorbance peak areas of nitrile (2240 cm(-1)), carbonyl (1730 cm(-1))
   and C-H (1370 cm(-1)) groups were obtained for 48 colorless acrylic
   fibers by infrared (IR) microspectroscopy. The carbonyl signal, related
   to the comonomers most commonly used in acrylic fibers, was ratioed
   against the nitrile and C-H bands, pertaining to the backbone of the
   polymer chains. The ratios A(1730)/A(2240) and A(1730)/A(1370), a
   relative measure of the comonomer content in the fiber, were used to
   differentiate the samples. A decrease in the crystallinity of fibers has
   been noted with increasing comonomer content. Relative standard
   deviation (R.S.D.) of the ratios were 1 and 3\% for repetitive analyses
   on the same location and along the length of the same single fiber,
   respectively. When different fibers of the same sample were examined,
   results were reproducible within 6\%. This simple method can greatly
   enhance the evidential value of colorless acrylic fibers, being able to
   discriminate them and thus helping the Court to better assess their
   significance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   where geophysics would have proven challenging. Subjective surveys using
   the standard 1 m probe located the trench; summary digital output from
   the weight gauge (contoured on site in 1 h) allowed the original form of
   the trench to be ascertained. This is a preliminary note: the technique

   enhanced, because the detrimental effect of the elements can be ruled

Abstract = {{Fifty-eight garments were taped and searched for mid to dark blue wool
   fibres. These were then removed from the tapings, mounted on slides and
   examined using a high-power microscope (400x). A total of 2,740 blue
   wool fibres were identified and visible range microspectrophotometry
   (MSP) was performed on them.
   Three hundred independent blue wool populations were identified on 56 of
   the 58 garments searched. The lack of control fibres meant the spectral
   range of each population was unknown. The number of populations may have
   been underestimated by grouping together the fibres that had broad
   single peaks and a lack of distinguishing features in the spectra.
   Although blue wool is considered to be a common fibre type, 300 unique
   spectral shapes were identified by the use of microspectrophotometry
   alone. This demonstrates that the dyes used in the dyeing of blue wool
   are variable. Showing that many different populations of blue wool occur
   on a range of garments should ensure that the forensic scientist does
   not underestimate or understate the strength of evidence in cases where
   blue wool is found. Hopefully this work will enlighten scientists and
   enable them to also assess the true value of their findings when other
   commonly occurring fibres are encountered.}},

Abstract = {{Four sets of acrylic fibre samples were obtained from a company that
   dyes fabrics for the fashion industry. Between seven and ten different
   batches of fibres constituted each set. Comparison microscopy, visible
   and UV range microspectrophotometry and thin layer chromatography (TLC)
   were used to compare the dyes on each batch of fibres within the sets.
   Only one of the four sets exhibited variation within the batches. The
   differences were seen when both microscopical and analytical techniques
   were used.
   In addition, two further sets of samples had been obtained from a
   company that produces carpets for the car industry. The first set
   consisted of 26 batches of acid dyed orange nylon fibres. The second
   consisted of 21 batches of acid dyed mustard coloured nylon and direct
   dyed brown viscose fibres blended together.
   When the first set was viewed under UV light one batch had more pale
   orange fibres present and they fluoresced more brightly than the other
   fibres. This could be due to the blending with a different dye batch of
   fibre or due to poor dye uptake-the latter being more likely. When
   tested using visible and UV range microspectrophotometry and TLC,
   further dye batch variation was not detected.
   The second set was examined after separating the nylon and viscose
   fibres from each other. The nylon fibres were indistinguishable when a
   range of microscopical and analytical techniques were employed; however,
   the viscose fibres showed dye batch variation when TLC was used.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of reactively-dyed wool and cotton were obtained from a range of
   dye manufacturers, dye distributors and the Forensic Science Service
   (FSS) Fibre Data Collection. The wool fibers were red in color and had
   previously been compared using comparison microscopy (CM), visible range
   microspectrophotometry (VS) and thin layer chromatography (TLC). The
   cotton fibers were blue and black in color and had not been previously
   compared. Red, blue and black fibers were chosen because they are often
   encountered in casework. The usage of reactive dyes to color fibers has
   increased over the last 10-15 years and these are often seen in
   casework. Before techniques were available that allowed reactively-dyed
   fibers to be compared using TLC only CM and microspectrophotometry were
   routinely carried out. Many laboratories, who had a
   microspectrophotometer, only had a visible range instrument. It was
   therefore important to see which techniques provide additional
   information, that gives greater individuality to fibers, to that
   obtained from CM. The color was released from the wool and cotton fibres
   using alkaline hydrolysis and a cellulase enzyme respectively. Many of
   the red wool samples were differentiated from each other using CM. More
   differentiation was found using VS and even more when ultraviolet range
   microspectrophotometry (UV) or TLC was used. Two samples could only be
   differentiated using TLC because CM, VS and UV failed to separate them.
   The black cotton samples were predominately differentiated using CM but
   VS allowed for further differentiation. With the samples used in this
   project UV and TLC failed to separate the samples further. The blue
   cotton samples benefited from the use of CM, VS and either UV or TLC to
   reduce the number of matching pairs. All techniques aided
   differentiation although with this set TLC and UV proved to be
   complementary techniques. Results demonstrate that TLC and UV both yield
   important information over and above that obtained from CM and VS.
   Although in some parts of the project TLC and UV are complementary if
   the concentration of the dye in the fiber is not sufficient for TLC or
   the scientist doesn't wish to `destroy' the fiber UV would be of more
   use than TLC.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and rapid method based on solid phase microextraction (SPME)
   via direct immersion followed by gas chromatography coupled with
   electron impact ionization/mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) was developed
   for the determination of strychnine in blood. Papaverine was used as
   internal standard (I.S.). Two types of fibre coating were tested, 100
   mum polydimethylsiloxane and 65 mum Carbowax(TM)/Divinylbenzene, the
   latter giving higher recoveries of the compound. The main factors
   affecting the SPME process, such as sample dilution (1: 10), adsorption
   and desorption times (20 and 10 min, respectively), carry-over effect
   (not observed), pH and salt addition (no modifications on pH or salt
   concentration) were optimized. The procedure was validated in terms of
   linearity (r(2) = 0.9992 for concentrations ranging from 0.10 to 5.00
   mug/mL), intra and interday precision (0.93 and 4.62\%, respectively at
   0.50 mug/mL; 3.33 and 8.06\%, respectively at 2.50 mug/mL), sensitivity
   (6.83 and 8.91 ng/mL for LOD and LOQ, respectively) and extraction
   recovery (0.54 and 0.39\% at 0.50 and 2.50 mug/mL, respectively). The
   developed procedure was found suitable for forensic investigations and
   was considered a good alternative to the liquid-liquid extraction
   methods normally used for the determination of this compound in
   biological media. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a CNS depressant that has been abused
   recreationally for its purported euphoric and relaxation effects and for
   the purposes of drug facilitated sexual assault due to its sedative and
   amnesic effects at higher doses. The dramatic increase in the abuse of
   GHB and association in criminal investigations over the past decade has
   created the need for forensic laboratories to develop analytical methods
   to detect GHB in a variety of matrices. The method developed in this
   work used solid-phase microextraction (SPME) to extract GHB from aqueous
   samples followed by on-fiber derivatization and analysis by gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). This method detected GHB in
   aqueous matrices with good sensitivity, high precision, excellent
   linearity from 0.01 mg/mL to 0.25 mg/mL, and without the need for sample
   manipulation that could cause interconversion between GHB and its
   lactone, GBL. The method was successfully applied for detection of GHB
   in spiked water and beverage samples.}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Fibres used in forensic casework suffer from a disadvantage common to
   other forms of trace evidence - it is not possible to state with
   absolute certainty that they originate from a specific source. Target
   fibre studies, population studies and research on `blocks of colour'
   have effectively demonstrated the polymorphism of textile fibres
   (particularly man-made ones) and have shown that when a fibre is
   believed to have a specific putative source, the chance that it has
   originated from a different source purely by coincidence is extremely
   remote. A study by Houck MM (Houck MM, Inter-comparison of unrelated
   fibre evidence. Forensic Science International 2003; 135: 146-149) has
   shown that no coincidental matching fibres were recovered from items of
   clothing examined in 20 unrelated crimes. The study involved over two
   million comparisons. This work goes a step further, and using the
   example of blue polyester fibres shows that even within a very narrow
   segment of the whole general fibre population, many examples of a
   specific colour/type of man-made fibre taken from random sources can be
   compared and the chance of any two being the same is very low. These
   studies should help to show the specificity and value of transferred
   fibres in providing forensic evidence.}},

   by insects feeding on a corpse. The case studies include bite patterns
   of mites, and ecologically restricted fly species which were found on
   the corpse of a sailor which had passed through different ecosystems. In
   addition, it is shown that insects can be utilized as classical stains
   comparable with fiber traces. Throughout the essay, emphasis is placed
   on the differences in conceptual and research procedures between the
   humanities and the natural sciences, and it is pointed out that a mutual
   understanding requires continuous efforts and open minds on both sides.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most commonly employed
   polymers in the textile industry. Its relevance as a source of evidence
   in the reconstruction of criminal cases is nevertheless very limited
   because the properties and morphologies of fibers from different
   producers tend to be very similar. By integrating bands, obtained on
   single fibers by infrared (IR) microscopy, associated with traits and
   gauche conformation and to the O-H end-groups of the molecules, a method
   is proposed that can discriminate otherwise similar PET fibers. The
   absorbancies at 1370 and at 846 cm(-1) relative, respectively, to the
   gauche and traits conformation, were measured and ratioed. The end-group
   content was evaluated by ratioing the absorbancies of the signals at
   3440 and at 874 cm-1. Relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) was 1\% for
   repetitive analyses on the same location of the same single fiber.
   Precision was reduced if the ratios were measured along the length of a
   single fiber (R.S.D. = 3\%) and even further when different fibers of
   the same sample were examined (R.S.D. varied from 2 to 10\%). This
   simple method can greatly enhance the evidential value of PET fibers by
   subclassifying them, thus helping the Court to better assess their
   significance.}},

Abstract = {{The 100th anniversary of the foundation of the German Society of Legal
   Medicine is a good opportunity to review its contributions to forensic
   wound ballistics. The present article gives ail overview of the
   scientific development in this field with special emphasis on work
   pioneering new developments and findings valid up to the present day,
   for example the presence of carboxyhemoglobin in the vicinity of the
   entrance wound as a sign of a contact or close-range shot {[}A. Paltauf,
   Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 3 (1890) 984-991, 1015-1017]; the correct
   interpretation of the muzzle imprint {[}A. Werkgartner, Beitr. Gerichtl.
   Med. 6 (1924) 148-161] and the retrograde ballooning of the bullet
   entrance region in contact shots {[}F. Hausbrandt, Dtsch. Z. ges.
   Gerichtl. Med. 38 (1944) 45-76; H. Elbel, Med. Welt 20 (1958) 343-345];
   wound patterns from captive-bolt livestock stunners {[}H. Czursiedel,
   Dtsch. Z. ges. Gerichtl. Med. 28 (1937) 132-133]; singeing of synthetic
   fiber textiles in close-range shots with nitro powder ammunition {[}S.
   Berg, Arch. Kriminol. 124 (1959) 5-8,17-22]; the wound ballistic
   processes on penetration of the bullet and the origin of the abrasion

   More recently medicolegal research in the German-speaking countries
   covered the following subjects: studies of the dynamic bullet-target
   interactions in experimental gunshots to simulants and composite body
   models; use of modern imaging techniques (CT, MRI) in the pre-autopsy
   diagnosis of lethal gunshot injuries; injuries from blank guns;
   mechanisms of incapacitation by gunshot injuries; development of
   improved methods for the evidence of gunshot residues on the firing
   hand; backspatter from close-range shots; medicolegal contributions in
   the discrimination of accidental, homicidal and suicidal gunshot

Abstract = {{TATP in post explosion exhibits was reported earlier to be best
   recovered from vapor phase. A typical procedure includes its adsorption
   on Amberlite XAD-7, elution with acetonitrile and analysis by GC/MS. In
   this work, improved recovery of TATP from the vapor phase was achieved
   by SPME using PDMS/DVB fiber and immediate sampling to GC/MS. The
   recovery of TATP by SPME was compared with headspace and with adsorption
   on Amberlite XAD-7 by spiking onto filter paper put in a 100 mL beaker.
   The limit of detection of TATP was 6.4 ng in these conditions, few
   orders magnitude more than in the other tested methods. Recovery of TATP
   in the presence of various solvents was also studied. Acetone, water,
   and mixtures of water:alcohols (1:1) were found to reduce the recovery
   of TATP. Using SPME, TATP has been identified in dozens of

Abstract = {{The surface topography of human hair, as defined by the outer layer of
   cellular sheets. termed cuticles, largely determines the cosmetic
   properties of the hair. The condition of the cuticles is of great
   cosmetic importance, but also has the potential to aid diagnosis in the
   medical and forensic sciences. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been
   demonstrated to offer unique advantages for analysis of the hair
   surface, mainly due to the high image resolution and the case of sample
   preparation. This article presents an algorithm for the automatic
   analysis of AFM images of human hair. The cuticular structure is
   characterized using a series of descriptors, such as step height, tilt
   angle and cuticle density. allowing quantitative analysis and comparison
   of different images. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by
   a classification study. Thirty-eight AFM images were measured,
   consisting of hair samples from (a) untreated and bleached hair samples,
   and (b) the root and distal ends of the hair fibre. The multivariate
   classification technique partial least squares discriminant analysis is
   used to test the ability of the algorithm to characterize the images
   according to the properties of the hair samples. Most of the images
   (86\%) were found to be classified correctly.}},

Abstract = {{A new target fibre study was undertaken building upon eight previous
   published studies, which are reviewed here. Fifty-eight items of outer
   clothing, obtained from households across England, were taped and
   searched for three types of commonly occurring fibres and one less
   common fibre type. The tapes were examined using a combination of
   automatic and manual searching. Any fibres similar to the target fibres
   were removed and examined using micro spectrophotometry, comparison
   microscopy, thin layer chromatography (TLC) and fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) where applicable. One polyester fibre, four
   acrylic fibres and eleven wool fibres were found that matched the three
   commonly occurring target fibre samples. None of the less common
   polyester fibres were found. One item had six matching wool fibres and
   another had the polyester fibre and an acrylic fibre recovered from it.
   The remaining eight fibres were each recovered from individual items.
   The results suggest that finding a large number of fibres that match a
   control is unlikely to happen by chance, which supports the findings of
   the previous target fibre studies.}},

   presented. The main parameters affecting the DI-SPME process, such as
   SPME fibers, salt additives, pHs, extraction temperatures and immersion
   times were optimized for simultaneous determination of the drugs. The
   extraction efficiencies were 0.0180-0.988 and 0.0156-2.76\% for whole
   blood and urine, respectively. The regression equations of the drugs
   showed excellent linearity for both samples; the correlation
   coefficients (r(2)) were 0.994-0.999. The detection limits for whole
   blood were 0.05-1 mug ml(-1), and those for urine 0.01-0.6 mug ml(-1).
   Actual quantitation could be made for pentobarbital in whole blood and
   urine obtained from volunteers, who had been orally administered a
   therapeutic dose of the drug. The DI-SPME/GC-MS procedure for
   barbiturates established in this study is simple and sensitive enough to

   A ``pseudo- 1:1{''} taping permitted to reconstruct the spatial

   The Likelihood Ratio (LR) was calculated, in order to quantify the
   support given by forensic evidence to the explanations proposed.
   A generalization of the Likelihood Ratio equation to cases analogous to
   this has been derived.

Abstract = {{Aims: To develop a non-invasive method to demonstrate the presence of
   haemoglobin and its degradation products in bruises in live human
   subjects for the purposes of objectively assisting in the determination
   of the age of a bruise.
   Methods: The cuvette holder unit of a Cary 100 Bio UV-Visible
   Spectrophotometer was replaced with the manufacture's fibre optic cable
   and optical reflectance probe. The probe was placed on the skin surface.
   The absorption spectrum from 780 to 380 nm was collected and transformed
   into the first derivative. Calculation of the first derivative permits
   absorption attributed to haemoglobin degradation ( primarily to
   bilirubin, but also haemosiderin) to be separated from absorption by
   haemoglobin. First derivative and colorimetry values, expressed as
   CIEL{*} a{*} b data, were derived from scans of 50 bruises.
   Results: The fibre optic cable and probe allowed the spectrophotometer
   to collect reproducible absorption spectra of bruises in the skin of
   living subjects. A bruise at three days has greater negative first
   derivative values at 480 and 490 nm than does a fresh bruise, indicating
   the local degradation of haemoglobin. Correlation between the first
   derivative and the CIEL{*} a{*} b ``b'' values in a series of bruises
   indicates that the yellow colour in a bruise is proportional to the
   amount of local haemoglobin breakdown.
   Conclusion: The ability to demonstrate the presence of haemoglobin and
   measure its degradation in bruises in living human subjects by a
   non-invasive method has not been described previously, and may be of use
   in the objective ageing of bruises for forensic purposes.}},

   5\% of the total. Natural fibres (mainly cotton) were predominant
   (72.3\%) and man-made fibres were considerably less frequent. When
   colour and generic type were classified together, the most common
   combinations were black and blue cottons. The least common were the
   man-made fibre/colour combinations with the most frequent of these
   accounting for less than 7\% of the sample. Fibre loads carried by long
   hair were found to be significantly less than that carried by short
   hair. The results of this study are in accordance with previous fibre
   population studies using other types of recipient surfaces and are
   likely to be influenced by factors such as seasonal and geographical
   variation.}},

Abstract = {{LC-MS is used for the identification of dyes extracted from textile
   fibers and the utility of the method for forensic trace analysis is
   demonstrated. The technique is shown to provide a high degree of
   chemical structural information, making dye identification highly
   specific in comparison to optical and/or chromatographic methods of dye
   analysis. A UV-visible absorbance detector, placed in series before the
   MS detector, facilitates monitoring the elution of dyes in the presence
   of other non-dye components extracted from colored textile fibers. In
   this way, dye identification becomes practical, even when a dye standard
   is not available for comparison. A set of 22 reference dyestuffs and 10
   dyes extracted from textile fibers were analyzed to demonstrate the
   utility of the method. Six of the extracted dyes corresponded to dyes
   also contained in the set of 22 reference dyestuffs. Reference dyestuffs
   were not available for four of the extracted dyes. Triethylamine (TEA)
   was shown to increase the electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry
   (ESI-MS) response of dyes containing multiple sulfonated groups.}},

Abstract = {{Sample preparation is an essential step in analysis, greatly influencing
   the reliability and accuracy of resulted the time and cost of analysis.
   Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME) is a very simple and efficient,
   solventless sample preparation method, invented by Pawliszyn in 1989.
   SPME has been widely used in different fields of analytical chemistry
   since its first applications to environmental and food analysis and is
   ideally suited for coupling with mass spectrometry (MS). All steps of
   the conventional liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) such as extraction,
   concentration, (derivatization) and transfer to the chromatograph are
   integrated into one step and one device, considerably simplifying the
   sample preparation procedure. It uses a fused-silica fibre that is
   coated on the outside with an appropriate stationary phase. The analytes
   in the sample are directly extracted to the fibre coating. The SPME
   technique can be routinely used in combination with gas chromatography,
   high-performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis and
   places no restriction on MS. SPME reduces the time necessary for sample
   preparation, decreases purchase and disposal costs of solvents and can
   improve detection limits. The SPME technique is ideally suited for MS
   applications, combining a simple and efficient sample preparation with
   versatile and sensitive detection. This review summarizes analytical
   characteristics and variants of the SPME technique and its applications
   in combination with MS. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

   luminescence measurements e.g. to characterize materials, for use in
   medical/pharmaceutical applications, for forensic and sensor

   hazardous environments, benefit from the use of optical fibers.
   Furthermore many high power applications in medicine and industry are
   looking to use UV wavelengths. All silica compositions are-better able
   to provide transmission of uv wavelengths, however there have been
   limitations on their use. Numerical aperture and solarization of the
   fibers are main concerns. Fibers have been recently developed which can
   be used for extended periods of time at wavelengths from 193 to 400 nm
   without serious degradation of their transmission properties
   (non-solarizing) and with significant broader numerical apertures,{[}NA]
   of 0.26-0.30 allowing sampling of larger areas and greater collection of
   transmitted or reflected beams from materials under test. Mechanical and
   spectral properties for these new fibers will be presented and compared
   with the standard all silica fibers. This will include reliability test
   results at selected UV wavelengths. Possible application areas which
   would particularly benefit from these high NA, UV non-solarizing optical
   fibers will be suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there have been some reports on the mummies from the medieval
   tombs in Korea, which were not made on purpose. Although these mummies
   could be an invaluable source for the studies on the physical state of
   medieval Koreans, there were not any reports on this subject until now.
   In this study, we first tried to investigate the various tissues using
   light- and electron-microscopic techniques. In the organs we have
   examined, even though the collagen fibers were profusely found within
   all of them, some types of cells, such as red blood cells, chondrocytes,
   hepatocyte and muscle cells, were also visible in various tissues. The
   histological characteristics of the current case seemed to be well
   matched with the previous study in general even though there were also
   somewhat different findings from the previous reports on the mummies.
   Although the cause of the mummification in Korea was not completely
   explained, we think that the cause in this case could be correlated with
   cultural aspects-not with natural conditions-because the mummies were
   only found in cases where the lime-soil barrier was maintained until
   their discovery, and which separated the inner space of the coffins from
   the outer space. As similar cases are frequently reported nowadays,
   invaluable data on the physical status of the medieval Koreans could be
   attainable if systemic investigation could be performed on similar cases
   which are found in the future. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

   simple vapor-phase procedure for the conversion of solid drug salt
   samples into their free bases by the use of triethylamine. This process
   can be conducted simultaneously with headspace SPME, the outcome being
   that solid drug salts can be sampled directly for GC-MS without the need
   for dissolution and chemical processing. Potential applications for this
   methodology include the noninvasive recovery of drug traces from objects
   such as banknotes and garments.
   This new process for recovery of amphetamine-type drugs has been
   combined with on-fiber derivatization using alkylchloroformates. This
   extra step was included to improve the chromatographic performance of
   analytes and allow for the resolution of drug enantiomers.}},

   and analyzed with GC-MS. The decrease in concentration of the combustion
   product naphthalene was monitored in all shells over a two-month period.
   Three conditions were examined to prevent naphthalene from escaping
   prior to testing the shells. A glass vial was successfully incorporated
   to halt the dissipation of naphthalene. At room temperature the
   naphthalene peak can be measured for several months and the
   curve-fitting data can lead to an estimation of time since discharge.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of headspace solid-phase microextraction
   (SPME) combined with gas chromatography to identify the signature odors
   that law enforcement-certified detector dogs alert to when searching for
   drugs, explosives, and humans. Background information is provided on the
   many types of detector dog available and specific samples highlighted in
   this paper are the drugs cocaine and
   3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA or Ecstasy), the explosives
   TNT and C4, and human remains. Studies include the analysis and
   identification of the headspace `fingerprint' of a variety of samples,
   followed by completion of double-blind dog trials of the individual
   components in an attempt to isolate and understand the target compounds
   that dogs alert to. SPME-GC/MS has been demonstrated to have a unique
   capability for the extraction of volatiles from the headspace of
   forensic specimens including drugs and explosives and shows great
   potential to aid in the investigation and understanding of the
   complicated process of canine odor detection. Major variables evaluated
   for the headspace SPME included fiber chemistry and a variety of
   sampling times ranging from several hours to several seconds and the
   resultant effect on ratios of isolated volatile components. For the drug
   odor studies, the CW/DVB and PDMS SPME fibers proved to be the optimal
   fiber types. For explosives, the results demonstrated that the best
   fibers in field and laboratory applications were PDMS and CW/DVB,
   respectively. Gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC/ECD)
   and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was better for analysis of nitromethane
   and TNT odors, and C-4 odors, respectively. Field studies with detector
   dogs have demonstrated possible candidates for new pseudo scents as well
   as the potential use of controlled permeation devices as non-hazardous
   training aids providing consistent permeation of target odors.}},

Abstract = {{The questioned document laboratory is often called upon to decipher

   ink's components absorb into the substrate's fibers and can be

   A case is described here that involved the theft of a credit card. An
   empty plastic credit card holder was found in the possession of a
   suspect, and was submitted for examination. Indented impressions could
   be discerned on its clear plastic window and presumably originated from
   the credit card that had been held in the envelope. These indented
   impressions were deciphered in the hope that they would reveal enough
   details from the credit card to establish a connection between the

   With methods generally utilized in the toolmarks and materials

Abstract = {{The estimation of time since the latest discharge of pistols and

   sampling technique and the GC/TEA analytical system. The TEA2 compound,
   which in our previous work (1) was observed in barrels of shotguns and
   rifles as well as inside spent cartridges, was also detected in pistols
   and revolvers. The amount of this compound was very low in
   short-barreled small arms and its escape from the barrel could generally
   be measured for only a few days or up to two weeks after the latest
   discharge. To improve the detection of TEA2 compound, the SPME sampling
   time was prolonged and fibers coated by Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane
   were used.
   The decrease of the TEA2 peak with time after shooting from pistols is
   nonexponential but the curve-fitting procedure proposed for the
   estimation of time since discharge of shotguns and rifles is difficult
   to apply as the decay is very rapid. Therefore, the detection of TEA2
   compounds in small arms should be interpreted that the firearm had been
   used very recently. The amount of volatile decomposition products of
   smokeless powder increased significantly with the length of the barrel
   when firearms of the same caliber, but with different barrel lengths
   were investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Short tandem repeat (STR) markers are the DNA marker of choice in
   forensic analysis of human DNA. Here we extend the application of STR
   markers to Cannabis sativa and demonstrate their potential for forensic
   investigations.
   Ninety-three individual cannabis plants, representing drug and fibre
   accessions of widespread origin were profiled with five STR makers. A
   total of 79 alleles were detected across the five loci. All but four
   individuals from a single drug-type accession had a unique multilocus
   genotype. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed significant
   genetic variation among accessions, with an average of 25\% genetic
   differentiation. By contrast, only 6\% genetic difference was detected
   between drug and fibre crop accessions and it was not possible to
   unequivocally assign plants as either drug or fibre type. However, our
   results suggest that drug strains may typically possess lower genetic
   diversity than fibre strains, which may ultimately provide a means of
   genetic delineation.
   Our findings demonstrate the promise of cannabis STR markers to provide
   information on: (1) agronomic type, (2) the geographical origin of drug
   seizures, and (3) evidence of conspiracy in production of clonally
   propagated drug crops. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights

   reporting because of the use of thresholds and the suppression of the
   prior probabilities related to the case. We will also show how to assess
   the performance of those forensic systems through Tippet plots. Finally,
   an example is shown using NIST-Ahumada eval'2001 data, where the speaker
   recognition abilities of our system are assessed through DET plots.
   using then these raw scores as evidences into the forensic system, where
   relative to populations we will obtain the corresponding likelihood
   ratios values, which are assessed through Tippet plots.}},

   included resin/fibre content, full-scale testing of portions of the deck
   and rig and forensic analysis of the rig and hull. A side note includes
   a discussion of another post-accident structural analysis. The primary

Abstract = {{Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is well documented with respect to
   its convenience and applicability to sampling volatiles. Nonetheless,
   fire debris analysts have yet to widely adopt SPME as a viable
   extraction technique, although several fire debris studies have
   demonstrated the utility of SPME coupled with gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify ignitable liquids. This work considers
   the expansion of SPME sampling from the customary thermal desorption
   mode to solvent-based analyte desorption for the analysis of ignitable
   residues. SPME extraction fibers are desorbed in 30 muL of nonaqueous
   solvent to yield a solution amenable to conventional GC-MS analysis with
   standard autosampler apparatus. This approach retains the advantages of
   convenience and sampling time associated with thermal desorption while
   simultaneously improving the flexibility and throughput of the method.
   Based on sampling results for three ignitable liquids (gasoline,
   kerosene, and diesel fuel) in direct comparisons with the widely used
   activated charcoal strip (ACS) method this methodology appears to be a
   viable alternative to the routinely used ACS method.}},

Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Symmetrically tapered planar IR waveguides have been fabricated by
   starting with a ZnS coated concave piece of single-crystal Ge, embedding
   it in an epoxide resin as a supporting substrate, and then grinding and
   polishing a planar surface until the thickness at the taper minimum is <
   30 mum. Such tapering is expected to enhance a waveguide's sensitivity
   as an evanescent wave sensor by maximizing the amount of evanescent wave
   energy present at the thinnest part of the waveguide. As predicted by
   theory, the surface sensitivity, i.e., the absorbance signal per
   molecule in contact with the sensing region, increases with decreasing
   thickness of the tapered region even while the total energy throughput
   decreases. The signal-to-noise ratio obtained depends very strongly on
   the quality of the polished surfaces of the waveguides. The surface
   sensitivity is superior to that obtained with a commercial Ge attenuated
   total reflection (ATR) accessory for several types of sample, including
   thin films (< 10 ng) and small volumes (< 1 muL) of volatile solvents.
   By using the waveguides, light-induced structural changes in the protein
   bacteriorhodopsin were observable using samples as small as similar to50
   pmol (similar to1 mug). In addition, the waveguide sensors can reveal
   the surface compositions on a single human hair, pointing to their
   promise as a tool for forensic fiber analysis.}},

   telephoto camera with an optical-fiber coupled Raman probe head.
   Spectral analysis was achieved using an optical-fiber coupled
   spectrograph employing a volume-phase holographic grating, charge
   coupled device array detection and visible excitation. Thus, spectra may
   be acquired from objects encased in transparent packaging or behind
   glass windows. The use of a modified SLR camera enables accurate sample
   alignment using the visible spectrum and collection of surface-enhanced
   resonance Raman scattered flux through the SLR camera lens using
   epi-illumination. A single operator may acquire fingerprint recognition
   of a material using a single hand-held unit and spectrum-matching

Abstract = {{Disruption of fast axonal transport as a result of traumatic brain
   injury is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid precursor
   protein (APP) in axonal swellings. A recent report has suggested a
   correlation between the size of axonal swellings and survival time up to
   about 85 h after blunt head injury. The authors of the report concluded
   that this correlation, in conjunction with other evidence, might be
   useful in forensic science for timing injuries. To test this hypothesis
   we have used image analysis software to measure a number of different
   morphological parameters of axonal swellings. Paraffin sections from 63
   cases of fatal head injury were stained with an antibody raised against
   the N-terminus of APP and counterstained with haematoxylin. Three
   different measurements were made of the APP-immunoreactive axonal
   swellings from the corpus callosum: (i) minimum and (ii) maximum Feret
   diameters, and (iii) area. Linear regression revealed a significant
   correlation between survival time and the minimum Feret diameter (P
   <0.0001) and the area (P <0.001) of axonal swellings. Our findings are
   in agreement with the previous study in that there is a significant
   correlation between axonal swelling size and survival time. However, we
   would suggest that the large variability in swelling size within
   individual cases and the heterogeneity of the original trauma seriously
   compromise the utility of such information in the timing of lesions.}},

Abstract = {{A forensic investigation was performed to understand the failure of a
   continuous fiber ceramic composite tube used in a slot-forge furnace.
   The failure study consisted of visual inspections of both failed shards
   and as-received samples taken from a section removed before the tube was
   placed in service. Semi-quantitative SEM, X-ray diffraction, and
   microstructural analyses were also performed to determine the nature of
   glazing observed on the surface of the failed tube. Based on this
   analysis, the failure was apparently caused by oxidation and an eventual
   ``burn-through and collapse{''} that was most likely precipitated by
   significant temperature excursions in excess of 1427 degreesC. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The present study examined the hypothesis that collagen fibril diameter
   and crimp angle in ruptured human Achilles tendons differed from that of
   intact ones. Tissue samples were obtained from the central core (distal
   core) and the posterior periphery (distal superficial) at the rupture
   site, and the proximally intact (proximal superficial) part of the
   tendon in 10 subjects (38 +/- 8 years) with a complete tendon rupture.
   For comparisons corresponding tissue samples were procured from age (38
   +/- 7 years) and gender matched intact Achilles tendons during routine
   forensic autopsy. The cross-sectional area density and diameter
   distribution of fibrils were analyzed using stereological techniques of
   digitized electron microscopy biopsy cross-sections, while crimp angle
   was measured by the changing banding pattern of collagen fibers when
   rotated between crossed polars. Nine of 10 persons with tendon ruptures
   reported that the injury did not occur during exceedingly large forces,
   and none experienced any symptoms in the days or months prior to the
   injury. Fibril diameter distribution showed no region-specific
   differences in either the ruptured or intact tendons for either group.
   However, in the distal core there were fewer fibrils in the ruptured
   compared to the intact tendons in 60-150 nm range, P<0.01. Similarly, in
   the distal superficial portion there were fewer fibrils in the ruptured
   compared to the intact tendons in the 90-120 nm range, 2P<0.05, while
   there were no differences in the proximal superficial tendons. Crimp
   angle did not display any region-specific differences, or any difference
   between the rupture and intact tendons. In conclusion, these data
   suggest that although crimp morphology is unchanged there appears to be
   a site-specific loss of larger fibrils in the core and periphery of the
   Achilles tendon rupture site. Moreover, the lack of symptoms prior to
   the rupture suggests that clinical tendinopathy is not an etiological
   factor in complete tendon ruptures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. and

   time taken to search for and examine them, unless evidence of their
   transfer will reinforce other fibre evidence. Additional problems
   specific to black spun dyed cellulosic fibres are the difficulties in
   assessing the degree of delusterant present and in distinguishing
   between viscose and modal. Samples of black spun-dyed viscose/modal were
   obtained from manufacturers, and examined together with fibres from
   casework garments to assess how well they could be differentiated from

Abstract = {{In order to create and study wound morphology, a ``skin-skull-brain
   model{''} had to be designed which would make the laboratory
   reproduction of a real ballistic injury possible.
   To simulate the human skin, an artificial skin (a silicon cap) is used.
   This silicon scalp contains synthetic fibers (artificial leather) to
   simulate the collagen and fat of the scalp. The artificial skull is a
   layered polyurethane sphere (19 cm o.d.; and 5, 6, or 7 mm thick)
   constructed in a specially designed form with a Tabula externa, Tabula
   interna, and a porous Diploe sandwiched in between. The periostium of
   the artificial skull is made of latex. This elastic latex layer prevents
   the bone fragments from scattering after the model has been struck by
   gunfire. The brain itself is simulated with ordnance gelatin, 10\% at 4
   degreesC, a material well known in wound ballistics. Gunshots were fired
   at a distance of 10 m from the model.
   During the evaluation of the ``skin-skull-brain model{''}, it was
   possible to show that injuries inflicted to this model are fully
   comparable to the morphology of equivalent real gunshot injuries.
   Using the ``skin-skull-brain model{''} has some significant advantages:
   the model is inexpensive, easy to construct, instantly available for
   use, and eliminates ethics conflicts. The main advantage of such a model
   is, in comparison with biological substances, the high reproducibility
   of inflicted traumas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To obtain effective findings to criminal investigation, a procedure was
   attempted for bloodstain examination, in which DNA typing was performed
   together with chemical analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry,
   using only single stain. DNA was decontaminated by passing through a
   solid-phase extraction cartridge, and some chemicals were eluted from
   this cartridge. The derivatized chemicals with MBTFA and BSTFA were
   extracted into SPME-fiber for subjecting to GC-MS analysis. DNA-typing
   was identifiable in a blood stain corresponding to 1 ml of blood. Also,
   mass spectra of some biogenetic compounds and methamphetamine were
   detectable in experimentally prepared bloodstains. This procedure is
   useful for practical examination of bloodstain because of high
   sensitivities for both of DNA-typing and chemical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the innovative use of an inexpensive
   Multi-Channel Capillary-based Electrophoresis (MCCE) system in
   combination with disposable separation cartridge for routine analysis of
   DNA fragments. The proposed multi-channel system is based on a novel
   multiplexed fluorescence detection technology, which provides a rapid
   and unique solution for DNA analysis. Presently the Capillary
   Electrophoresis (CE) based technology used for DNA analysis, rely on gas
   discharge UV-Visible lamps or lasers as light sources that are bulky,
   expensive, and difficult to couple one's light output into optical
   fibers, for miniaturization of the optical detection system. The light
   sources hinder the development of small sized, high-throughput and
   cost-effective genomics instrument. Whereas, the proposed instrument
   with solid-state light sources and non-moving detection micro-optics,
   and re-usable cartridge containing multiple separation channels, provide
   a cost-effective solution for a robust CE instrument. Furthermore, the
   simplified operation of the MCCE instrument will drastically reduce the
   cost of DNA analysis, and possibly will be the instrument of choice for
   forensic DNA and molecular diagnostics applications in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{In 2001, guidelines concerning cannabis were issued by the Group of
   Forensic Chemistry of the Swiss Society of Forensic Medicine. These
   guidelines deal with the sampling of Cannabis plants and their
   processing before analysis. Some recommendations are also suggested for
   the determination of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC). In
   this paper, the biosynthetic pathway of Delta(9)-THC is presented and
   the putative ecological function of the cannabinoids discussed. The
   taxonomy and botany of the hemp plant are also considered. The influence
   of age, sex, and plant part on the accumulation of Delta(9)-THC is
   discussed. The need for criteria aimed at the distinction between fiber
   hemp and cannabis belonging to the drug type is especially emphasized.
   The current Swiss situation and legislation are briefly presented.
   Furthermore, the sampling of cannabis material, its processing and
   analysis are described, alternative strategies for the characterization
   of hemp exhibits are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Optical examination, lifting techniques and electron microscopy are the
   most widely used methods for the determination of the writing order of
   crossing texts. Measuring the topography of the surface can provide
   additional information or determine the writing order where the common
   methods fail. Laser profilometry, as a non-contact technique, leaves the
   surface of the questioned documents unaltered. Several samples of
   crossing strokes, differing in writing pressure and support, were
   scanned. Depending on the type of support, a paper block or a metal
   surface, two phenomena were observed: The paper fibers are compressed
   and the line shows through. Despite of the complicating inhomogeneous
   structure of the paper, the writing sequence was determined
   unambiguously in the majority of the experiments. This makes laser
   profilometry a promising technique in fraud detection.}},

Abstract = {{Crime laboratories in the USA, who undertake fiber examinations,
   together with members of the European Fibres Group (plus representatives
   from Israel, Japan, Canada, and Australia) were surveyed in 1994 and
   1995, respectively, and asked to provide subject-specific information
   relating to personnel, equipment, training, quality control, and
   techniques available. The information obtained showed that generally
   more fiber casework is carried out in Europe than in the USA. Most
   laboratories are quite well equipped but those in Europe seem to be able
   to obtain more state-of-the-art instrumentation. Proficiency testing and
   peer review is accepted practice worldwide. Americans appear to update
   fiber collections on a more regular basis than Europeans but both keep
   literature up to date. Contamination is a major issue, as with all areas
   of trace evidence. The results from the survey suggest that minimum
   standards are clearly not always being observed. Careful consideration
   also needs to be given as to whether legitimate contact could have
   occurred prior to an offense being committed.
   The standard of forensic fiber examination worldwide is generally high.
   With laboratory management continuing to support the work of the
   Scientific Working Group for Materials and the European Fibres Group and
   by instigating ``best practice{''} as set out in their guidelines,
   standards should continue to improve.}},

Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Forensic scientists are faced with the problem of estimating the
   frequency of cotton fibres recovered in casework, in relation to those
   in the general population. One way of doing this is to consider the
   degree of spectral variation that occurs within a ``block of colour{''}.
   When a spectral pattern occurs very frequently, the evidential value of
   the fibres may be so low, that it is not worth considering them as
   target fibres. Using UV-visible range microspectro-photometry (MSP)
   spectra were recorded from 88 known black cotton dyes and 225 samples of
   black cotton taken from various textiles. UV-visible spectra originating
   from sulphur dyes and from the great majority of reactive and direct
   dyes can be easily recognised. Vat dyes present a little more
   difficulty. The degree of spectral variation and consequent
   discriminating power of MSP varied according to the dye class, from 0.13
   for sulphur dyes to 0.93 for reactive dyes. From 99 textiles dyed with
   reactive dyes, the spectra could be divided into at least 40 varieties
   showing that these fibres have a high degree of individuality. Within
   the few direct dyes (11.5\%) that were encountered, one basic spectral
   form predominated, but a number of minor variations were observed.
   Spectral information below 400nm (UV-range) is important for making
   distinctions and is critical in the case of direct dyes.}},

Abstract = {{Laser micropyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is used for
   the analysis of paint, photocopier toner, and synthetic fiber materials
   to test the forensic potential of this emerging technology. It uses a
   laser microprobe to selectively target very small parts of the materials
   for GC-MS analysis. Whereas the paint and the toner samples were
   amenable to direct laser pyrolysis, the synthetic fibers proved
   transparent to the 1064 nm laser radiation. The difficulty with the
   fibers demonstrates that a specific laser wavelength may not be
   appropriate for all types of materials. Nevertheless, the fibers were
   able to be indirectly pyrolyzed by impregnation in a strongly absorbing
   graphite matrix. A vast array of hydrocarbon pyrolysates was detected
   from the different materials studied. Unique product distributions were
   detected from each sample and in sufficient detail to facilitate
   individual molecular characterization (i.e., molecular fingerprinting).
   The integrity of the laser data were confirmed by comparison to data
   obtained from the same samples by the more conventional pyroprobe
   pyrolysis GC-MS method. The high spatial resolution and selectivity of
   the laser method may be advantageous for specific forensic applications,
   however, further work may be required to improve the reproducibility of
   the data.}},

Abstract = {{Several applications of Raman spectroscopy in the forensic sciences have
   recently been demonstrated, but few have involved the analysis of
   paints. Undoubtedly. this is a reflection of the sample degradation
   problems often encountered when a visible or near-infrared laser is
   focused on a light-absorbing matrix. In this study, a dispersive CCD
   Raman spectrometer (785 nm) was used in a configuration which collected
   scattered light from an excitation region 3 mm long and 80 mum wide,
   instead of from a focused spot. Sample degradation was not observed, and
   Raman spectra of automotive paints of all colors were readily obtained.
   Most of the paints analyzed were U.S. automobile original finishes (1974
   to 1989) from the Reference Collection of Automotive Paints, and the
   inorganic pigments examined were those which had been identified
   previously by infrared spectroscopy in finishes from this collection.
   Prominent peaks of rutile were observed in Raman spectra of
   light-colored nonmetallic finishes for both monocoats and
   basecoat/clearcoat systems, and the rutile peaks are readily
   distinguished from those of anatase. The lead chromates (Chronic Yellow,
   Molybdate Orange, and silica-encapsulated versions of the two) are the
   strongest Raman scatterers among the pigments examined, and Chrome
   Yellow was identified by Raman spectroscopy in several yellow and orange
   nonmetallic monocoats for which infrared absorptions of this pigment
   were not observed. Raman spectroscopy also provides an unequivocal means
   to distinguish Chrome Yellow from Molybdate Orange. This is Particularly
   helpful for the analysis of paints containing light pigment loads or
   encapsulated pigments since the two formulations cannot be
   differentiated by infrared spectroscopy in such cases. The
   iron-containing pigments, ferric oxide, hydrous ferric oxide, and
   Prussian Blue, are relatively weak Raman scatterers, but peaks of
   hydrous ferric oxide and Prussian Blue were observed in spectra of
   paints containing heavy pigment loads. Because no sample preparation is
   required, Raman spectroscopy provides an excellent means to rapidly
   screen reference panels for the presence of certain pigments, and some
   examples of the differences in Raman spectra which occur for paints
   having similar colors are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The current emphasis on DNA technology in forensic science has led many
   to believe that trace evidence examinations, including fibers, may be of
   little value. Reasons are given here to show that this is an erroneous
   assumption. In the Face of this situation, fibers examiners have been
   challenged to consider ways in which they can improve the services they
   offer to the Criminal Justice System not only by increasing the
   efficiency of the examinations, but also by expressing the evidential
   value of the findings in a clearer way. The separate stages within
   fibers casework from evidence collection to report writing are
   critically examined. Suggestions are made on how improvements may be
   achieved. Areas where particular progress can be made include improving
   communication and exchange of information between the investigator and
   the scientist and streamlining analysis by using the latest equipment in
   conjunction with effective case management. In addition, ways of making
   better use of existing data pertaining to Fiber frequencies,
   accumulating new data by using the resources of working groups, and
   improving training procedures with respect to evidence interpretation

Abstract = {{This study investigated fibre movement within and out of a search room,
   when performing a garment examination. The effect of the collection
   procedure (taping v. scraping) on the number of contaminant fibres
   produced, and the effectiveness of a number of cleaning techniques and
   varying degrees of examiner hygiene were also studied. Fibre movement
   was found to be dependent upon distance, with fibre populations
   decreasing with increasing distance from the garment examination area.
   Most fibres were deposited during the actual examination. Cotton fibres
   were more easily shed and also found to be airborne for longer periods
   of time than wool, acrylic and polyester fibres. The `scraping method'
   of fibre recovery was found to result in an increase in the number of
   loose fibres with transfer to the examiner's clothing and a number of
   fibres exiting the search room. It is unlikely that a completely clean
   search room can be obtained. However, with proper precautions it is
   possible to minimise and monitor the contaminant fibre population. These
   features are presented and discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{A review of the scientific paper published on inorganic gunshot residue
   (GSR) analysis permits to study how the particle analysis has shown its
   capability in detection and identification of gunshot residue. The
   scanning electron microscope can be the most powerful tool for forensic
   scientists to determine the proximity to a discharging firearm and/or
   the contact with a surface exposed to GSR. Particle analysis can
   identify individual gunshot residue particles through both morphological
   and elemental characteristics. When particles are detected on the
   collected sample, the analytical results can be interpreted Following
   rules of a formal general interpretative system. to determine whether
   they come from the explosion of a primer or From other possible sources.
   The particles on the sample are compared with an abstract idea of
   ``unique{''} GSR particle produced by the sole source of the explosion
   of a primer. ``Uniqueness' is not the only problem related to GSR
   detection and identification for a forensic scientist, With
   ``not-unique{''} particles interpretation of results is extremely
   important. The evidential strength of ``not-unique{''} particles can
   increase with a more fruitful interpretative framework based on Bayes
   rule. For the assessment of the value of a GSR in linking a suspect and
   a crime. it is important to compare two hypothesis: the first can be
   that of the evidence if the suspect has been shooting in a specific
   situation, the second that of the evidence if the suspect was not
   involved in this shooting. This: case specific or case-by-case approach
   is closer to what the court is interested in. The authors consider that
   a ``case-by-case{''} approach should be followed whenever possible.
   Research of models and data such as those developed in other tract:
   evidence material (fibres, glass, etc.) using a Bayesian approach is
   suggested in the interpretation of GSR. (C) 2001 Elsevier science

Abstract = {{Single fibres dyed by indigo and its seven derivatives were measured by
   microspectrophotometric examination of transmittance spectra in the
   ultraviolet-visible region (240-760 nm). Glycerin was the most suitable
   embedding reagent for this measurement. Small intra-sample variation of
   the transmittance intensity in single woollen fibres was observed, but
   relatively large inter-sample variation was observed among the fibres
   obtained from different areas in the same textile. There were no
   differences in the lambda max, lambda min and the position of shoulders
   observed in their spectra. This method was applied to the discrimination
   of single cotton fibres dyed by vat dyes, such as indigo and seven
   indigo derivatives which had similar structures. On the basis of the
   ultraviolet-visible transmittance spectra, these sample fibres could be
   distinguished from one another. It is a non-destructive method compared
   with chromatographic dyestuff extraction methods; furthermore,
   utilization of the ultraviolet region gave spectra providing useful
   information for evaluating fibre evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) uses a small volume of sorbent
   dispersed typically on the surface of small fibres, to isolate and

   nature of the coating) until an equilibrium is reached in the system.
   The amount of:an analyte extracted by the coating at equilibrium is
   determined;by the magnitude of,the. partition coefficient of the analyte
   between the sample matrix and the coating material. After the

   and quantitation of target analytes. This technique integrates sampling,
   extraction and sample introduction and is a simple way of facilitating

Abstract = {{Chromatographic methods are preferred in the analysis of organic
   molecules with lower molecular mass (<500 g/mol) in body fluids, i.e.,
   the assay of drugs, metabolites, endogenous substances and poisons as
   well as of environmental exposure by gas chromatography (GC) and liquid
   chromatography (LC), for example. Sample preparation in biomedical
   analysis is mainly performed by liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase
   extraction. However, new methods are investigated with the aim to
   increase the sample throughput and to improve the quality of analytical
   methods. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was introduced about a
   decade ago and it was mainly applied to environmental and food analysis.
   All steps of sample preparation, i.e., extraction,. concentration,
   derivatization and transfer to the chromatograph, are integrated in one
   step and in one device. This is accomplished by the intelligent
   combination of an immobilized extraction solvent (a polymer) with a
   special geometry (a fiber within a syringe). It was a challenge to test
   this novel principle in biomedical analysis. Thus, an introduction is
   provided to the theory of SPME in the present paper. A critical review
   of the first applications to biomedical analyses is presented in the
   main paragraph. The optimization of SPME as well as advantages and
   disadvantages are discussed. It is concluded that, because of some
   unique characteristics, SPME can be introduced with benefit into several
   areas of biomedical analysis. In particular, the application of
   headspace SPME-GC-MS in forensic toxicology and environmental medicine
   appears to be promising. However, it seems that SPME will not become a
   universal method. Thus, on-line SPE-LC coupling with column-switching
   technique may be a good alternative if an analytical problem cannot be
   sufficiently dealt with by SPME. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The collection and preservation of microtrace evidence with the aid of
   an adhesive tape is a method of choice in forensic science. This
   technique is rapid and easy and allows the concentration of microtraces
   on a carrier, which facilitates further investigations in the
   laboratory. Adhesive tapes are currently used to secure microtraces of
   fibers and glass, but hardly for traces of automotive paint and other
   lacquers for fear of interference with the analysis of binders. A
   collection of automotive paint consisting of original and repair
   lacquers collected by tape has been evaluated. After various times of
   storage within the tape, these samples were compared with untreated
   references by microscope FT-IR and microspectrophotometry (MSP). Another
   set of paints was collected in 1984, stored within the tape until 1995,
   and examined the same way. About 170 layers of lacquer with various
   types of binder were examined. With the exception of one clear lacquer
   no difference between treated samples and references was detected. This
   small difference observed could be correlated to the exposure to xylene
   (extractant) and was not caused by the storage within the adhesive tape.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization for headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was
   studied with a view to performing gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric
   (GC-MS) screening of volatile hydrocarbons (VHCs) in blood. Twenty
   hydrocarbons comprising aliphatic hydrocarbons ranging from rt-hexane to
   n-tridecane, and aromatic hydrocarbons ranging from benzene to
   trimethylbenzenes were used in this study. This method can be used for
   examining a burned body to ascertain whether the victim had been alive
   or not when the burning incident took place. n-Hexane, n-heptane and
   benzene, the main indicators of gasoline components, were found as
   detectable peaks through the use of cryogenic oven trapping upon SPME
   injection into a GC-MS instrument. The optimal screening procedure was
   performed as follows. The analytes in the headspace of 0.2 g of blood
   mixed with 0.8 ml of water plus 0.2 mug of toluene-d(3) at -5 degreesC
   were adsorbed to a 100-mum polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber for 30 min,
   and measured using the full-mass-scanning GC-MS method. The lower
   detection limits of all the compounds were 0.01 mug per 1 g of blood.
   Linearities (r(2)) within the range 0.01 to 4 mug per 1 g of blood were
   only obtained for the aromatic hydrocarbons at between 0.9638
   (pseudocumene) and 0.9994 (toluene), but not for aliphatic hydrocarbons
   at between 0.9392 (n-tridecane) and 0.9935 (n-hexane). The coefficients
   of variation at 0.2 mug/g were less than 8.6\% (n-undecane). In
   conclusion, this method is feasible for the screening of volatile
   hydrocarbons from blood in forensic medicine. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a simple and effective adsorption
   and desorption technique, which eliminates the need for solvents or
   complicated apparatus, for concentrating volatile or nonvolatile
   compounds in liquid samples or headspace. SPME is compatible with
   analyte separation and detection by gas chromatography and
   high-performance liquid chromatography, and provides linear results for
   wide concentrations of analytes. By controlling the polarity and
   thickness of the coating on the fibre, maintaining consistent sampling
   time, and adjusting other extraction parameters, an analyst can ensure
   highly consistent, quantifiable results for low concentration analytes.
   To date, about 400 articles on SPME have been published in different
   fields, including environment (water, soil, air), food, natural
   products, pharmaceuticals, biology, toxicology, forensics and theory. As
   the scope of SPME grew, new improvements were made with the appearance
   of new coatings that allowed an increase in the specificity of this
   extraction technique. The key part of the SPME fibre is of course the
   fibre coating. At the moment, 27 variations of fibre coating and size
   are available. Among the newest are a fibre assembly with a dual coating
   of divinylbenzene and Carboxen suspended in poly(dimethylsiloxane), and
   a series of 23 gauge fibres intended for specific septumless injection
   system. The growth of SPME is also reflected in the expanding number of
   the accessories that make the technology even easier to use Also
   available is a portable field sampler which is a self-contained unit
   that stores the SPME fibre after sampling and during the shipment to the
   laboratory. Several scientific publications show the results obtained in
   inter-laboratory validation studies in which SPME was applied to
   determine the presence of different organic compounds at ppt levels,
   which demonstrates the reliability of this extraction technique for
   quantitative analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A 26-year-old woman collapsed and died suddenly while dancing. Autopsy
   findings included the cutaneous lesions of pseudoxanthoma elasticum
   (PXE), a rare genetic disease with autosomal dominant and recessive
   inheritance patterns, Pathologic findings of PXE (degenerated elastic
   fibers) were seen in the stenotic epicardial coronary arteries, the
   intramyocardial arterioles, the subendocardium, the mitral valve, and
   the blood vessels of other viscera. The mitral valve was slightly
   myxoid, Intramyocardial arteriolar involvement has nor been previously
   described in PXE. The other cardiac findings have only been described in
   a few cases. Although mitral valve prolapse in PXE has been shown
   echocardiographically, it is unclear whether or not the mitral valve
   findings in this case represent the substrate for this condition. It is
   important that autopsy pathologists search carefully for the
   pathognomonic skin lesions of PXE in cases of sudden death associated
   with coronary disease, mitral valve prolapse, or endocardial lesions.
   Recognition of this disease is essential for proper genetic counseling
   of surviving family members. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B. Saunders

Abstract = {{Recently, practitioners of forensic textile fibre examinations have been
   forced to consider how they can improve the service that they can offer
   to law enforcement agencies. The focus so far has been largely on
   assessing which examinations are likely to provide the most worthwhile
   information to the customer and to prioritise examinations within a
   case. The use of new analytical equipment may help to completely revise
   the traditional sequence of examinations used in casework, resulting in
   greater speed and efficiency. The ultimate end product of a case for the
   forensic scientist is his/her report produced to assist the court in
   reaching a verdict after considering the evidence. To be effective,
   scientific evidence must be correctly interpreted and properly
   presented. If this is not done, increasing the effectiveness of case
   work in laboratories is largely wasted. Irrespective of whether a
   Bayesian approach is used, a key factor involved in the interpretation
   of fibres evidence is that of estimating fibre frequency. A survey was
   carried out among fibre examiners in laboratories represented in the
   European Fibres Group and in the fibre section of the Scientific Working
   Group for Materials in the United States. Part 1 of the results reports
   on their current perception of fibre frequencies and factors influencing
   them. In the light of the results, the author has tried to identify
   diversity, evaluate competence and to derive some recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of paint and fingernail polish samples, which were visually
   similar, but had different chemical compositions and formulations, was
   analyzed using quadrupole static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).
   Coating distinction was easily achieved in many cases because of the
   presence of dominant ions derived from the components of the coating,
   which could be observed in the SIMS spectra. In other instances, coating
   distinction was difficult within a product line because of spectral
   complexity; for this reason and because of the large numbers of spectra
   generated in this study, multivariate statistical techniques were
   employed, which allowed the meaningful classification and comparison of
   spectra. Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principal Component Analysis
   (PCA) were applied to quadrupole SIMS data. PCA showed distinct spectral
   differences between most spectral groups, and also emphasized the
   reproducibility of the SIMS spectra. When using PLS analysis, reasonably
   accurate coating identification was achieved with the data. Overall, the
   PLS model is more than 90\% effective in identifying the spectrum of a
   particular coating, and nearly 100\% effective at telling which coating
   components represented in the PLS models are not present in a spectrum.
   The level of spectral variation caused by sample bombardment in the SIMS
   analysis was investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR) and quadrupole static SIMS. Changes in the FT-IR spectra were
   observed and were most likely a result of a number of factors involving
   the static SIMS analysis. However, the bulk of the sample is unaltered
   and may be used for further testing.}},

Abstract = {{A previously unknown ligament, the superficial anulus fibrosus ligament
   (SAFL), situated on the ventral part of the L5 intervertebral disc (ID)
   was observed and described from autopsy material. Twenty-eight cadaveric
   specimens from 12 black and 16 white persons aged 17-30 years were
   studied during routine forensic autopsies. The anterior longitudinal
   ligament was separated from the ID and the ventral part of the SAFL was
   visualized. The SAFL samples were removed, measured and studied with
   both conventional histology and examination by transmission electron
   microscopy. The SAFL was a completely separate ligament at the level of
   the L5-S1 ID situated between the anterior longitudinal ligament and the
   anulus fibrosus of the ID. The fibers of the ligament were vertically
   oriented. A difference in distance between the L5-S1 vertebral bodies
   ventrally was noted in the two groups studied (18.7 +/- 1.2 mm in the
   black vs. 15.2 +/- 1.0 mm in the white, p < 0.001), indicating a
   difference in the ventral thickness of the intervertebral disc. Also,
   there was a difference in the length (black: 17.7 +/- 1.6 mm vs. white:
   14.1 +/- 1.1), thickness (black: 3.3 +/- 0.3 mm vs. white: 2.1 +/- 1.9),
   and the cross-sectional area (black: 58.2 +/- 6.7 mm(2) vs. white: 26.5
   +/- 2.7 mm(2), p < 0.001) of the SAFL. Conventional light microscopy
   revealed no obvious differences. However, transmission electron
   microscopy revealed notably larger collagen fibril diameter in black
   than white subjects. In conclusion, the interbody distances were greater
   in the black group, indicating a greater intervertebral disc thickness,
   compared to that of the white. Furthermore, the SAFL was significantly
   longer and thicker in the black than in the white group. Albeit
   unsubstantiated, these race-specific macroscopic findings may have
   implications for understanding the etiology of various low back stress
   problems. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperpolymorphic short tandem repetitive DNA sequences, STRs or
   microsatellites, have become widely used in human identification,
   particularly in criminal cases and in mass disasters. In such cases the
   substrates for the analyses may he decomposed biological material, a
   fact that has to be taken into account when choosing the appropriate
   casework methods. In this paper we report the evaluation of five
   different DNA extraction methods, namely the phenol-chloroform, the
   silica based, the InstaGene Matrix(TM) (BioTest), the glass fiber
   filter, and the Chelex based methods. The substrates for the analyses
   are decomposed human liver tissue specimens from forensic autopsy cases.
   Extracted DNA was quantified and DNA profiled by a set of seven STRs. We
   have compared laboratory time consumption and costs of the five methods,
   showing that the Chelex method is the more rapid and less expensive of
   the methods, the phenol-chlorophorm and silica extractions being the
   most time consuming and resource demanding ones. A full profile was
   obtained by the silica method in nine out of ten cases and this method
   failed to give a reliable type in four out of 70 STR analyses. The
   phenol-chlorophorm and the glass fiber filter methods failed in 16
   analyses, the InstaGene Matrix(TM) (BioTest) in 25 and the Chelex
   extracts in 56 of the 70 STR analyses. By multiple logistic regression
   we show that the difference between the silica procedure and the other
   methods are statistically significant. In our hands, the silica gel
   extraction procedure is an obvious choice when the biological material
   available is decomposed human tissue even if this procedure is one of
   the more laborious ones. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Several criteria are proposed for making decisions about comparing sets
   of debris involving the transfer of non-component particles and
   fibers-those produced from something other than the item itself-using a
   model based upon rudimentary set theory. Decisions about the
   significance of an association or an exclusion based upon trace evidence
   require an evaluation of debris in its context; reference points for
   such evaluation are presented. Samples of debris from the sites relevant
   to the event under investigation must be available, as well as debris
   standards from the usual environments of the people involved, and must
   be adequate to permit a determination of normal versus foreign debris.
   Criteria are proposed for establishing contact based upon corresponding
   sets of particles and fibers, for excluding contact in the absence of
   corresponding particles or fibers, and for refraining from making either
   an association or an exclusion. Conditions for reaching qualified
   conclusions or other types of associations when these criteria are only
   partially met are also discussed; conclusions may sometimes be reached
   if potential sources for debris particles and fibers can be found.
   Decisions about the strength of an association or an exclusion based
   upon comparisons of non-component debris particles and fibers can be
   made by reference to the criteria for reaching a conclusion. The
   criteria can be tested via Bayes' Theorem. The analysis itself is based
   primarily upon light microscopy, although other methods may be used as
   well. Case examples are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The transfer and persistence of automotive carpet fibres to shoe soles
   was investigated. It was found that fibres were transferred with the
   normal activity of a car passenger. Carpet type and shoe sole parameters
   were significant determinants in the number of fibres that transferred.
   The average number of fibres was between about one and 33 per sole.
   Fibres that had been transferred after normal activity only persisted
   for a few minutes after walking. A survey of the shoe soles of people
   about to leave their car showed that fibres were usually present. The
   majority of shoe soles surveyed had less than five fibres with the
   greatest number of fibres found being 14. The likelihood of finding a
   large number of fibres on such soles is rare. Fibre composition of
   automotive carpets showed a high degree of variation. Grey was seen to
   be a common colour irrespective of the colour of the vehicle body.}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy offers the potential for the identification of
   illegal narcotics in seconds by inelastic scattering of light from
   molecular vibrations, In this study cocaine, heroin. and MDMA were
   analyzed using near-IR (785 nm excitation) micro-Raman spectroscopy.
   Narcotics were dispersed in solid dilutants of different concentrations
   by weight. The dilutants investigated were foodstuffs (flour, baby milk
   formula), sugars (glucose, lactose, maltose, mannitol), and inorganic
   materials (Tale powder, NaHCO3, MgSO4. 7H(2)O). In most cases it was
   possible to detect the presence of drugs ar levels down to similar to
   10\% by weight. The detection sensitivity of the Raman technique was
   found to be dependent on a number of factors such as the scattering
   cross-sections of drug and dilutant, fluorescence of matrix or drug,
   complexity of dilutant Raman spectrum, and spectrometer resolution.
   Raman spectra from a series of 20 mixtures of cocaine and glucose
   (0-100\% by weight cocaine) were collected and analyzed using
   multivariate analysis methods. An accurate prediction model was
   generated using a Partial Least Squares (PLS) algorithm that can predict
   the concentration of cocaine in solid glucose from a single Raman
   spectrum with a root mean standard error of prediction of 2.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{During forensic fiber investigations a material is searched for single
   fibers transferred in connection to a crime. If fibers can be matched it
   is an indication of a connection between the crime scene and the
   material investigated or between persons. This paper describes an
   automated searching system based on color image analysis. The system is
   primarily developed for forensic textile fiber investigations but the
   approach is also suitable for other applications, e.g. paint flake and
   spermatozoa detection. The present system is applied in the initial,
   time-consuming stage of the investigation to identify single fiber
   fragments for subsequent investigation with more selective and powerful
   techniques. Subjects discussed include hardware and software
   constructions, practical usefulness, operator requirements and possible
   future developments. Brief reviews of color description and forensic
   fiber investigations are also given. The system is based on commonly
   available techniques, i.e. a CCD-camera, a motorized sample table and an
   IBM-compatible PC/AT with add-on boards for video frame digitalization
   and stepping motor control as the main parts. With the aid of the
   HSI-color system (Hue-Saturation-Intensity) and software optimization it
   is possible to operate the instrument at full video rate and fiber
   detection capability comparable to human investigators. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{This study describes the characteristics of modacrylic fibres and

   morphological features which are a strong indication of their generic
   class. The infrared spectra provide information about the co-monomer,
   termonomers added to produced dye sites, the presence of solvent
   residue, dyes, and additives, e.g. flame retardant material. The
   infrared spectra should always be recorded before and after any thin

Abstract = {{This study represents a critical comparison of adsorbent based heated
   headspace methods for the enrichment of volatiles from fire debris. A
   dynamic and a static method, based on charcoal adsorption and solvent
   extraction are compared to the solid phase micro extraction (SPME)

   sampling rime, sampling temperature, analyte concentration and the
   effects of water, Collection efficiencies were evaluated for a variety
   of accelerant types, ranging from methanol to diesel fuel. The minimun
   detectable quantity for each of the methods is within an order of
   magnitude for most accelerant types. We propose a two step method based
   on SPME with two different fibers. Polar and water soluble accelerants
   such as ethanol and light petroleum distillates are most effectively
   enriched at low temperature on Carboxen(TM), a newly developed high
   capacity fiber which contains a carbon based adsorbent. Low volatility
   accelerants such as diesel fuel can be recovered on a methylpolysiloxane

Abstract = {{A derivatization/solid phase microextraction (SPME) method for the
   determination of benzoylecgonine in urine was developed. The
   derivatization is conducted directly in 1 mt of urine while sonicating
   for 3 min with 12 mu L of hexyl chloroformate and 70 mu L Of a mixture
   containing acetonitrile:water:hexanol:2-dimethylaminopyridine (5:2:2:1
   v/v), yielding benzoylecgonine hexyl ester (BHE) as the product. After
   the 3 min period, an aliquot of 25(1 mu L is transferred to a vial for
   SPME. After the desired extraction time the 100 mu m
   polydimethylsiloxane SPME fiber was transferred to the GC-E;IS for
   separation and analysis with a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer.
   The hexyl chloroformate derivatization and SPME procedures were
   optimized for compatibility and sensitivity. The method was found linear
   for 0.10 to 20.0 mu g/mL (r(2) = 0.999) of benzoylecgonine in urine
   using benzoylecgonine-d(3) as an internal standard (1.5 mu g/mL).
   Intra-day precisions were 8.8 and 6.8\% RSD for 0.30 mu g/mL and 17 mu
   g/mL benzoylecgonine standards in urine (n = 6), respectively. Inter-day
   precision (n = 3) were 3.3\% RSD, indicating good reproducibility. A
   detection limit of 0.03 mu g/mL (S/N = 3) was achieved, thus making the
   SPME method a simplified alternative to SPE for GC-MS confirmation after
   EMIT tests for benzoylecgonine which have a cutoff of 0.30 mu g/mL.
   Quantitative results by SPME and SPE of two clinical urine specimens
   known positive for cocaine by EMIT were in excellent agreement.
   Benzoylecgonine was detected by the derivatization/SPME method in 22 out
   of 22 other urine specimens known positive for cocaine.}},

   the fixed pattern noise and signal averaging, we obtained Raman spectra
   of a variety of common materials with reasonable signal-to-noise ratios
   at room temperature. Spectra having good signal-to-noise characteristics
   were collected on polystyrene spheres as small as 5 mu m in diameter and
   a nylon fiber 23 mu m in diameter. Although the sensitivity of the

   If the measurement method allows for identification with absolute

   without replacement from an urn containing balls of two colours,
   associated with a hypergeometric probability distribution. For the
   general situation, where certainty is less than 100\%, an adaptation of
   the classical urn model is proposed and solved. The paper specifically
   concentrates on fibres to illustrate the practical implementation of

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to improve the reliability of
   discrimination (or identification) of dyed hair by analyzing chemical
   substances present in the hair, as an addition to the conventional
   macroscopical and microscopical examinations and ABO blood group
   examination. Oxidation hair-dye components such as p-phenylenediamine
   (PPDA), toluylene-2,5-diamine (T-2,5-DA), o-aminophenol (OAP),
   in-aminophenol (MAP) p-aminophenol (PAP) and p-amino-o-cresol (PAOC)
   were selected as the object of study. After alkaline-digestion, hair
   samples were adjusted to a pH of 12.6 to 12.8, and applied onto an
   Extrelut column. After 15 min, the components were simultaneously
   extracted and derivatized with n-hexane including 1\%
   heptafluoro-n-butyryl (HFB) chloride. Their HFB derivatives within a
   condensed sample were diluted in ethyl acetate, and analyzed by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with full mass scanning or
   selected ion monitoring. For estimating their levels,
   2,4,6-trimethylaniline was used as the internal standard. Standard
   curves obtained by preparing a 5 cm segment of control hair spiked with
   authentic substances were linear, ranging from 0.1 to 4.0 mu g for PPDA
   and T-2,5-DA, and from 0.01 to 0.4 mu g for GAP, MAP, PAP and PAOC. The
   coefficient of variation of inter-day precisions (each n = 4) was below
   16\% for PPDA, below 20\% for OAF and PAP and below 24\% for T-2,5-DA,
   MAP and PAOC. These components were detectable even at 6 ng for PPDA,
   T-2,5-DA, MAP and PAP, 8 ng for GAP, and 4 ng for PAOC. Recovery
   percents using this procedure ranged from 54 to 86\%. By using actual
   dyed hair samples this method was shown to provide high sensitivity for

Abstract = {{Imaging time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was used
   to evaluate the detection of contaminant chemicals on the surfaces of
   single synthetic textile and canine hair fibers. The results of the
   study showed that a variety of chemical classes can be detected. Both
   cocaine and heroin could be easily observed as intact protonated
   molecules ({[}M + H](+)) in the cation spectra acquired from textile
   fibers. Two organophosphates were evaluated: malathion,which is a common
   pesticide, and pinacolyl methyl phosphonic acid (PMPA), which is the
   principal degradation product of the nerve agent soman (a close relative
   of sarin). Malathion could be observed as (CH3O)(2)P(=S)S-., which is
   formed by thiophosphate cleavage of the intact malathion. PMPA is
   observed as the conjugate base ({[}PA-IPA - H](.)). Surfactant chemicals
   found in hair care products were successfully detected on single hair
   fibers. Specifically, alkyl sulfates, ethoxylated alkyl sulfates,
   silicones, and alkylammonium compounds could be readily identified in
   spectra acquired from single hair fiber samples exposed to shampoo
   and/or conditioner. Generally, the results of the study show that
   imaging SIMS is applicable to single fiber analysis, for a range of
   adsorbed compound types. The forensic application of this instrumental
   approach has not been widely recognized. However, the ability of the
   technique to acquire specific chemical information from trace samples
   clearly points to applications where the need for chemical analysis is
   great, but the amount of sample is limited.}},

Abstract = {{A new infrared (IR) interferometric method has been developed in
   conjunction with low-loss, flexible optical fibers, sensors, and probes.
   This combination of fiber optical sensors and Fourier Transform (FT)
   spectrometers can be applied to many fields, including (i) noninvasive
   medical diagnostics of cancer and other different diseases i,? vivo,
   (ii) minimally invasive bulk diagnostics of tissue, (iii) remote
   monitoring of tissue, chemical processes? and environment, (iv) surface
   analysis of polymers and other materials, (v) characterization of the
   quality of food, pharmacological products, cosmetics, paper, and other
   wood- related products, as well as (vi) agricultural, forensic,
   geological, mining, and archeological field measurements. In particular,
   our nondestructive, fast, compact portable, remote, and highly sensitive
   diagnostics tools are very promising for subsurface analysis at the
   molecular level without sample preparation. For example, this technique
   is ideal for different types of soft porous foams, rough polymers, and
   rock surfaces. Such surfaces, as well as Living tissue, are very
   difficult to investigate by traditional FTIR methods. We present here
   FEW-FTIR spectra of polymers, banana and grapefruit peels, and living
   tissues detected directly at surfaces. In addition, results on the
   vibrational spectral analysis of normal and pathological skin tissue in
   the region of 850-4000 cm(-1) are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-phase microextraction (SPME), a new solvent-free sample
   preparation technique, was invented by C. Arthur and J. Pawliszyn in
   1990. This method mainly was applied for the extraction of volatile and
   semi-volatile organic pollutants in water samples. However, since 1995,
   SPME has been developed to various biological samples, such as whole
   blood, plasma, urine, hair and breath, in order to extract drugs and
   poisons in forensic field. The main advantages of SPME are: high
   sensitivity, solventless, small sample volume, simplicity and rapidity.
   We have reviewed the papers published in recent years about SPME in
   biological samples, and sorted out main experimental conditions, such as
   fibers, matrixes, the extraction approaches and time, as well as the
   acceleration method. We would expect SPME technique to have a promising
   future for toxicological analysis in forensic practice. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{In Part 3 of this series the authors have tried to evaluate the
   representativity of the Catalogue Data Base. At present this is only
   possible by comparing the fibre percentages obtained with figures from
   World Textile Production, with those of a more regional character, with
   existing data from alternative collections and with that from other
   enquiries. It is apparent that a true test for the representativity of
   the Catalogue Data Base is not possible. Figures which would be directly
   comparable do not exist. Nevertheless, it is possible to show that the
   most common fibre types and colours and their rank orders are the same
   in the different collections and production figures. The forensic value
   of common fibres when they appear in certain garments or combinations is
   presented and also the value of fibres which rarely appear in the CDB.
   The authors give an outlook on further activities to validate the data
   in the Catalogue Data Base and discuss the combination of the CDB data
   with that from alternative collections. Theoretical examples are
   presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) to investigate our own
   forensic neuropathological case material (n=252) in light of the current
   literature on the phenomenon ``axonal injury{''} (AI) to determine the
   incidence, specificity and biomechanical significance of AI and its
   significance for determining vitality and survival time. The case
   material consisted of cases of fatal nonmissile closed-head injury
   (n=119), gunshot injury (n=30), fatal cerebral ischemia/hypoxia (n=51),
   brain death caused by mechanical trauma (n=14) or nonmechanical injury
   (n=18), and acute hemorrhagic shock (n=20). AI was observed in 65\% to
   100\% of cases of closed-head injury, fatal cerebral ischemia/hypoxia,
   and brain death with a survival time of more than 3 h; AI could not be
   detected in the cases of acute hemorrhagic shock. A statistically
   significant difference between traumatically and nontraumatically
   induced (nondisruptive) AI was not found. There was no statistical
   evidence of a correlation between AI and the different types of external
   force, since AI could be demonstrated after both
   acceleration/deceleration injuries and traumatic impact. Therefore,
   biomechanical inferences for reconstruction purposes are not possible.
   On the other hand, beta-APP was found to be a definite marker of
   vitality. In our material, cases with a posttraumatic interval of under
   180 min did not express beta-APP. Moreover, the literature shows that
   the posttraumatic interval can be determined by other methods for
   demonstration of AI such as by ubiquitin immunostaining (360 min),
   silver staining (15-18 h), hematoxylin and eosin staining (about 24 h),
   or by demonstration of a microglial reaction (about 4 to 10 days) or of
   a few remaining isolated bulbs, without accompanying fibers, which can
   be detected after a survival time of up to 17 months. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray microanalysis (EDS) were
   used to conduct forensic investigations on metal and glass foreign
   objects. SEM-EDS is an excellent method for identifying metal foreign
   objects in food, such as wire, dental fillings, bone, and metal
   packaging, based on their element composition. From a determination of
   the extent of corrosion of a metal foreign object using SEM-EDS, it is
   sometimes possible to determine whether the material has been processed
   with the food product. Case histories of processed aluminum, unprocessed
   nickel-coated steel, and corrosion resistant stainless steel foreign
   objects are discussed. A potential product-tampering problem involving a
   hole defect in a paperboard package was resolved using SEM-EDS. Blue
   fibers found in the hole were found to contain brass particles from a
   ball point pen rather than a syringe needle. SEM-EDS has been used to
   determine the elemental composition of glass foreign objects and is able
   to distinguish between many types of glass including container,
   electrical, and bakeware. A case history is presented to show that
   although container glasses cannot, in general, be distiguished from one
   another using SEM-EDS, they can be distinguished by trace element
   semiquantitative spectrograghic analysis. SEM-EDS can be used to
   distinguish glass-like foreign objects from glass. Case histories of
   struvite crystals found in salmon and cream of tartar crystals found in
   grape juice are discussed. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) identified
   the cream of tartar crystal as calcium tartrate, and this complemented
   the calcium, carbon, and oxygen components of the compound found using
   SEM-EDS.}},

Abstract = {{Individualization of undyed fibers can be a problem in analyzing fiber
   evidence in forensic cases, in addition to the physical and optical
   microscopic features, the chemical composition information from single
   fiber FT-IR microspectroscopy may be useful. In the case of polyester,
   the most commonly used fiber, only a single generic class usually is
   recognized. Single fiber polarized FT-IR microspectroscopy provides a
   means of using the molecular orientation of the macromolecules in the
   fiber resulting from their manufacturing history to observe
   spectroscopic differences. Dichroic ratios for eight usable infrared
   bands for PET single fibers permit multidimensional discriminant
   analysis. The procedure described sorts PET fibers into 10 working
   subclasses and demonstrates the potential of this approach for single
   fiber individualization. This new dimension can be added to the
   traditional size, shape, and other distinguishing features.}},

Abstract = {{A set of fibers, mainly synthetic, has been examined by Raman microprobe

   Fibers of the same polymer type from different manufacturers have Raman
   spectra which are only slightly different but which could be
   distinguished by the multivariate statistical technique of principal
   components analysis (PCA). Dyed fibers gave spectra with bands due to
   the polymer, but also with intense bands due to the dye, because of the
   high Raman cross-section of dye molecules. Extraction of the dye,

Abstract = {{This Atomic Spectrometry Update is the latest in an annual series
   appearing under the title `Industrial Analysis'. The overall structure
   of the review is broadly the same as in previous years, but in order to
   adopt a more focused approach, the length of the review has been
   substantially reduced, concentrating on what we consider to be the most
   significant developments over the review period.
   As in previous years, direct analysis of solid samples continues to
   attract most attention in the field of industrial analysis. Although
   generally regarded as a mature technique, XRF continues to be one of the
   most widely used techniques for solids analysis and more recent
   developments, such as microfluorescence and portable instruments, are
   continuing to extend the range of applications. Use of glancing angle
   XRF is proving to be a viable technique for measurement of elemental
   depth profiles at surfaces (e.g., alloys and semiconductors) and TXRF is
   now firmly established as a technique of choice for manufacturing
   quality control and development of semiconductor devices. The high
   proportion of work dealing with standard samples, calibration and
   reproducibility of TXRF methods for analysis of semiconductors is
   testament to the degree of acceptance of the technique within the
   industry. Nevertheless, SIMS and SNMS continue to be widely used for
   spatially resolved analyses, depth profiling and investigation of ion
   implantation in semiconductor devices.
   Glow discharge sources for atomic spectrometry have been widely applied
   for direct analysis of conducting samples and the development of rf-GD
   sources is now extending the capabilities to non-conducting samples such
   as ceramics and refractories. Characterization and optimization of the
   sources has been continuing over the review period and the techniques
   appear to be reaching the stage at which they can be applied to real
   problems. However, the more traditional approach of mixing
   non-conductive samples with a conducting host and analysing using dc-GD
   sources continues to predominate.
   Laser ablation sampling for ICP-AES and ICP-MS, and LIBS, are also
   proving to be extremely useful techniques for direct analysis of
   conductive and non-conductive solids and have the additional advantage
   of permitting spatially resolved analysis. These techniques have been
   utilized for a wide variety of applications, ranging from forensic
   applications (where sample size is the limiting factor) to direct
   analysis of polymers, ceramics and refractories. LIBS is particularly
   suitable for application to real-world problems, since optical fibres
   can be used to transport the laser pulse to the sample and the emission
   signal to the spectrometer, permitting in-situ analysis of relatively
   inaccessible samples (e.g., painted surfaces). A particularly novel
   application of LIBS has even been described for analysis of steels
   underwater using pairs of laser pulses.
   For some niche applications, analysis of solid samples as slurries
   appears to be a practical proposition, although most of the work now
   seems to be concentrating on the use of electrothermal vaporization
   (ETAAS, ETV-ICP-MS/AES) rather than nebulizer systems, where sample
   transport through spray chambers, etc., can be problematical.
   Applications which have been described include ceramics, refractories,
   steels, polymers, quartz and fly ash.
   Other methods of sample introduction for ICP-AES and ICP-MS have also
   attracted considerable attention and limits of detection continue to be
   improved through chemical pretreatment and improved sample introduction
   methods. Use of ultrasonic and microconcentric nebulizers with membrane
   desolvation systems appears to be particularly advantageous for analysis
   of organic samples, permitting analysis of volatile solvents, reducing
   interferences, improving plasma stability and opening up the possibility
   of universal, solvent independent, calibrations. The low sample uptake
   rate of the microconcentric nebulizer is also particularly advantageous
   where sample size is limited (e.g., VPD analysis of semiconductors) or
   where waste must be minimized (e.g., nuclear applications).
   Applications of high resolution ICP-MS continue to be sparse, almost
   certainly limited by the high cost of the instrumentation. In some
   cases, the need for high resolution has been circumvented by use of
   `cool' plasmas and these are now being widely applied for determination
   of elements such as Ca, Fe, K, Li and Na down to ppt levels in clean
   matrices (e.g., semiconductor acids, high purity water). More complex
   matrices, however, will almost certainly require alternative methods for
   eliminating the problem of molecular ion interferences if use of high
   resolution is to be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Tortoise shell guinea pigs (n = 7) were administered codeine (1 mg/mL
   codeine-base) in their drinking water for 3 weeks. Black, reddish-brown
   and white hair was collected separately from each animal before and
   after treatment. The hair samples were analyzed by GC/MS. The experiment
   showed positive results for all hair fibers with large individual
   variability of drug incorporation. Low drug intake resulted in small
   differences of the drug content in hair fibers different in color
   whereas in cases of high drug intake a strong influence of hair
   pigmentation on the analytical results was observed. The highest drug
   content was always found in black hair samples, non-pigmented hair
   showed the lowest drug concentrations and the drug content in
   reddish-brown fibers was less than in black hair samples from the same
   animal. From the results it was concluded, that eumelanins rather than
   pheomelanins are the decisive factor for codeine-melanin binding in hair
   and the amount of drug intake was suggested to determine the relevance
   of hair pigmentation on the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{The primary task was to investigate and explain the source of blockage
   in an elbow (B2) and in other parts of the fuel supply unit recovered
   from the wreckage of a private airplane. A small clump of pollen
   associated with a disc-shaped gummy mass of plant fibers suggested that
   bees belonging to the family Megachilidae might have been responsible
   for accumulating these plant materials. Examination of other parts of
   the fuel control unit revealed three dead adult bees identified as Osmia
   gaudiosa Cockerell (Megachilidae) and a single dead individual of the
   genus Ashmeadiella (Megachilidae). A survey of the tubing of a heater
   that had been stored showed that 69\% of its tubings and fittings
   contained nest material and other arthropod debris including those of
   Ashmeadiella meliloti (Cockerell) and Anthidium sp. (Megachilidae).
   Through SEM examination, a single branched hair partly embedded in the
   clump of pollen was matched with the postgenal hairs of an adult
   Ashmeadiella. These facts left no doubt that the B2 elbow mass was part
   of a nest of Ashmeadiella. This conclusion was consistent with the facts
   that the wreckage had been available to the bees for nesting during the
   entire time of the spring and summer nesting season, and that the plant
   materials (leaves of Sphaeralcea and pollen sources) were readily
   available near the storage yard during that time. Contamination of the
   wreckage by nesting bees was obviously a post-crash phenomenon. Plant
   materials as well as dead bees would have been consumed by the intense
   fire that accompanied the crash if they had been present before.}},

Abstract = {{A pattern-recognition algorithm combined with near-infra-red reflectance
   spectroscopy has been modified to function as a non-destructive analysis
   technique for identifying dyes present on textiles. Samples of 261 dyes
   and textiles were measured in the 1100-2500 nm region to form a
   near-infrared (reflectance) spectral library. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) was used to generate an orthonormal reference library
   from the library of original spectra. The PCA algorithm treats the
   spectra in the library as an n component quantitative analysis problem
   in which each spectrum represents a standard mixture having a
   concentration of 1.0 for that component. Spectra of dyed textiles were
   used as an unknown set in a library search. This new method saves time
   and materials in comparison with traditional methods of analysing dyes
   present on textile fibres. The library of dye spectra can be developed
   from measurements made directly on dye powder without interference from
   inorganic diluents. The method was successfully used to identify the
   dyes present on five textiles. The technique is particularly well suited
   for studying forensic, historic and archaeological textiles because of
   its non-destructive nature and ability to analyse small amounts of

Abstract = {{A forensic-neuropathological case material was investigated to determine
   the significance of axonal injury (Al) as expressed by beta-amyloid
   precursor protein (beta-APP) mainly in the rostral pens. The material
   consisted of cases of fatal non-missile head injury (n=119), gunshot
   injury (n=30), fatal cerebral ischemia/hypoxia (n=51), brain death
   caused by mechanical trauma (n=14) or non-mechanically induced brain
   injury (n=18), and acute hemorrhagic shock without brain injury (n=20).
   Al was observed in 65\% to 100\% of cases of closed head injury, fatal
   cerebral ischemia/hypoxia, and brain death with a survival rime of more
   than 3 h. However, Al could not be detected in the cases of acute
   hemorrhagic shock. Thus the phenomenon of AI could not be assigned to a
   specific diagnostic group but was limited to cases of definite brain
   injury. There was no indication of any correlation with the types of
   external force as Al could be demonstrated in acceleration/deceleration
   injuries as well as following traumatic impact. On the other hand
   beta-APP was found to be a definite marker of vitality Contrary to the
   literature, beta-APP could not be demonstrated in our material in cases
   with a posttraumatic interval of under 105 min and in most cases of
   closed head injury or ischemia/hypoxia not until after 120 to 180 min.
   Moreover the posttraumatic interval can be determined by applying
   additional methods for demonstration of AI such as ubiquitin expression
   after 360 min, silver staining of axon-fibers after 15-18 h, hematoxylin
   and eosin staining after about 24 h, by demonstration of a microglial
   reaction after 4 to 10 days or of a few remaining isolated bulbs without
   accompanying fibers, which can be detected after a survival time of up
   to 17 months. Our results show that decomonstration of AI can answer
   some questions relevant to forensic-neuropathology.}},

Abstract = {{Live tests were performed to assess the transfer of wool fibres to vinyl
   and to leather vehicle seats. Five donor garments were involved. The
   results were compared with those from a simple laboratory shedding test.
   The loss of wool fibres from a vinyl seat due to secondary transfer and
   through vehicle usage was also investigated. Further experiments were
   concerned with the possibility of secondary transfer occurring after a
   change of clothing. Fibre transfer from wool garments was shown to
   depend not only on the nature of the recipient surface but on the
   textile construction of the donor and on the condition of the fibres.
   Live tests seem to provide the most accurate picture of shedding
   behaviour, but, as they are not always practical, suggestions are given
   for optimizing laboratory tests. New aspects of secondary transfer are
   illustrated. Fibre transfer has again been shown to be a complex subject
   in which it can be dangerous to make generalised assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{The most common alkyl nitrites encountered in forensic toxicology are
   iso-butyl, n-butyl and iso-pentyl(amyl) nitrites. All have become
   popular as an aphrodisiac, especially among the homosexual population.
   Alkyl nitrites are a volatile and unstable group of compounds, which
   hydrolyse in aqueous matrices to the alcohol and nitrite ion. Here we
   describe a fast, clean and sensitive procedure for the detection of
   hydrolysed n-butyl nitrite in whole human blood using a new,
   solvent-free sampling technique, the headspace solid-phase
   microextraction (HSPME), combined with GC/FID analysis. Sample
   preparation was investigated using tow different stationary phases (100
   mu m polydimethylsiloxane and 85 mu m polyacrylate), coating a fused
   silica fibre. The effect of different sampling times at fixed

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In contrast to skin wounds the characteristic forensic features of
   lesions of ligaments and tendons have rarely been investigated, However,
   in a suspected homicide the question became crucial whether an isolated
   discontinuity of the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane was caused by
   a rupture mechanism or by a cut, In order to reevaluate the associated
   criteria experimental lesions were made in ligaments and tendons and
   examined histologically. From these experiments the following criteria
   could be established: Lacerations exhibit complete destruction of the
   tissue texture with microruptures and splitting of fibres in the
   adjacent region, Such wound edges have an irregular structure and fibres
   near the rupture site exhibit variable thicknesses due to traction.
   Incisions exhibit smooth wound edges with no disturbance of the tissue
   texture. The thickness of fibres near the rupture site is regular. These
   results were obtained by light microscopical examination and confirmed
   using electron microscopy, Under controlled experimental conditions the
   forces necessary to rupture tendons with a diameter of I mm varied
   between 50-70 Newton (N). In the suspected homicide, the lesion of the
   posterior atlanto-occipital membrane was examined visually and
   histologically and was compared with the experimentally established
   criteria. Based on these criteria the lesion could be identified as an
   incision which had probably been caused accidentally while severing the
   medulla during the first autopsy and was therefore not connected with
   the cause of death.}},

Abstract = {{Levels of trace evidence transfer were examined in a casework context. A
   girl was allegedly abducted in a car and rape attempted by the accused,
   who denied any contact with the victim. Clothing worn by the victim and
   the accused, and the covers from the front seats of the car, were
   analyzed for trace evidence. Three types of corresponding fibers and
   four possible pathways of transfer were identified. Synthetic fibers
   similar to those composing the car seat covers were located on the
   victim's clothing, consistent with direct transfer. Secondary transfer
   was indicated by dyed brown human head-type hairs (possibly originating
   from the accused's wife) located on the seat covers and on the victim's
   clothing. Secondary and possibly tertiary transfer was indicated by pink
   synthetic material and associated fibers (possibly originating from the
   victim's mother) located on the victim's clothing, a car seat cover and
   the accused's clothing. Light microscopy, comparison microscopy, and
   cross-sectioning techniques were used. The multiple fiber matches and
   the differing pathways and levels of transfer increased the strength of
   the association between the accused and the victim. After the fiber
   evidence was led at the trial, the accused pleaded guilty, thereby
   affirming the value of secondary transfer evidence.}},

Abstract = {{A new `'class'' of writing ink, whose ink has new chemical features, is
   being introduced into the United States from Japan. The new ink is known
   as gel ink and it is water-based. It can be differentiated from the
   traditional water-based roller ball and porous tip class of writing inks
   by its chemical composition and physical properties. Gel inks differ
   from other water-based inks by the incorporation of colored pigments to
   give the inks a full range of colors without the use of colored
   dyestuffs commonly used in water-based inks. Other differences include
   gel ink's high viscosity, leading to the name `'gel ink.'' The gel pen
   is visually identifiable and different in appearance from other writing
   instruments by its clear outside barrel and fill tube, which contains
   the pigmented gel ink. The pen housing and fill tube is clear in order
   to display the actual color of ink. The plastic fill tube will be a
   larger diameter than the tube found in a ballpen and will contain a
   clear silicon grease plug. Gel inks are tested and differentiated from
   other writing inks by the same battery of tests used in the past.
   Nondestructively, gel pen writing can be visually examined for ink
   absorption into the paper fibers, color difference and overall line
   quality of the writing. Ultraviolet and infrared light examinations will
   also aid in differentiating gel inks from other writing inks.
   Destructive methods of testing gel ink may prove to be the most
   identifiable and demonstrative of all the available tests. Thin layer
   chromatography may be used to separate detectable components of inks.
   Gel inks that contain pigments and no dyestuffs for separation, will
   have a negative reaction in this area. The gel pen is a unique writing
   instrument because of the chemistry in the gel coupled with a new pen
   design. The water-based gel ink is environmentally friendly and
   permanent. These attributes may allow the gel pen a sizeable impact on
   the U.S. market.}},

Abstract = {{Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum (''massive fatty
   deposits in the atrial septum'') may represent an incidental autopsy
   finding or may be associated with atrial arrhythmias, obstructive
   symptoms, or sudden death. Antemortem diagnosis is becoming much more
   common. In a literature review and in a review of our 12 cases, this
   condition was found to occur more frequently in obese middle-aged or
   elderly subjects, who frequently demonstrated atherosclerotic coronary
   artery disease. The unencapsulated mass generally occurred anterior or
   superior to the fossa ovalis, and histologically was characterized by
   mature fat with varying quantities of fetal fat, inflammation and
   fibrosis, and entrapment of myocardial fibers with cytologic atypia.
   Cases were included that had a minimum atrial septal thickness of 1.0
   cm. The septum ranged up to 7.0 cm in maximum thickness (2.6 cm
   average). In our cases, no deaths were directly attributed to this
   disorder. It is important that forensic pathologists become more
   generally aware of this condition. To further delineate the true
   pathological significance, the atrial septum should be routinely
   examined by palpation and sectioning to determine its thickness and fat
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) provides the capability for
   elemental characterization of individual carpet fibers of a few
   millimeters in length. XRF is rapid, nondestructive, and provides
   adequate sensitivity to detect the presence of a variety of elements
   added to carpet fibers during their manufacture. Several metallic
   elements are commonly observed in automotive carpet fibers and are less
   frequently present in the residential carpet fibers in this study,
   making source classification of these fibers at least partially
   successful. Qualitative comparison of Ti-ray spectra may also provide
   some discrimination capability when used in conjunction with optical
   microscopy and polymer characterization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper represents an experimental approach of histology of the human
   hair fiber in dyeing and diffusion phenomena and its contribution to the
   interpretation of hair analysis results for drug abuse. Rhodamine B was
   applied to human hair fibers from either aqueous solution or
   methanol/ethanol solvent. The experiments were performed on natural hair
   of different ethnic groups as well as on extensively bleached hair
   strands. The microscopical study of the pathway of diffusion of
   rhodamine B into the hair fibers indicated that the reagent had entered
   the unmodified fibers at the scale edges between the cuticle cells. At
   the beginning of the diffusion process intercellular diffusion was the
   preferred route predominantly along the nonkeratinous regions of the
   cell membrane complex (CMC) and intermacrofibrillar cement. Penetration
   into the high sulfur regions of the fiber occurred as dyeing in aqueous
   solution proceeded and resulted in evenly stained cross sections. The
   dye distribution pattern observed in natural hair exposed to nonaqueous
   solution showed that rhodamine B did not penetrate the cortex cells as
   easy as from aqueous solution and selectively stained nonkeratinous
   regions only. The determination of the amount of dye taken up by the
   fibers by spectrophotometric analysis demonstrated that samples
   diffusion generally increased by time and temperature. It also depended
   on the morphology of the hair sample. The penetration of rhodamine B
   from aqueous solution was much greater than from methanol/ethanol
   solvent.}},

   has grown to its present level involving almost 400 laboratories
   worldwide. This is the first of two articles that review the objectives,
   limitations and results of this testing from 1978 through 1991. Part I
   reviews the success of laboratories in the identification and
   classification of common evidence types: controlled substances,
   flammables, explosives, fibers, bloodstains, and hairs. Laboratories
   enjoy a high degree of success in identifying drugs and classifying
   (typing) bloodstains. They are moderately successful in identifying
   flammables, explosives, and fibers. Animal hair identification and human
   hair body location results are troublesome. The second paper will review
   the proficiency of crime laboratories in determining if two or more
   evidentiary samples shared a common origin.}},

Abstract = {{Fibers of different textile materials, such as polyesters, viscose, and
   wool, were analyzed using TXRF, yielding a `'fingerprint-type'' trace
   element pattern. This pattern can be compared with quantitative results
   obtained from weighable amounts, e.g. 50 mu g of the material. It can be
   shown that, besides the omnipresent elements Ca, Fe and Zn, some of
   these materials contain specific elements, such as P, Mn or Sb, and that
   an identification is possible using these elements even when very small
   amounts of sample are involved (i. e. sub-microgram). Since many
   synthetics contain Ti as a matting additive, the Ti concentration can be
   used to further differentiate the sample material.}},

Abstract = {{A simple method for the extraction of 5 thinner components from human
   whole blood and urine, using the headspace solid-phase microextraction
   (SPME) method is presented. After heating a vial containing the samples
   with 5 compounds (toluene, benzene, n-butyl acetate, n-butanol and
   n-isoamyl acetate) at 80 degrees C, a polydimethylsiloxane-coated SPME
   fiber was exposed to the headspace of the vial to allow adsorption of
   the compounds. The fiber needle was then injected into a capillary gas
   chromatography (GC) port. The headspace SPME-GC gave intense peaks for
   each compound and a low level of background noise was seen only for
   whole blood. Recovery rates of the 5 compounds by use of the headspace
   SPME-GC were 50-70\%. Reproducibility for headspace SPME-GC data were
   excellent for both body fluids. The calibration curves showed linearity
   in the range 2-100 ng/0.5 ml whole blood or urine. The detection limits
   of each compound were 1.1-2.4 ng/0.5 ml sample. The present results on
   the analysis of 5 thinner components by headspace SPME-GC suggest its
   applicability to a number of other volatile compounds in forensic
   toxicology.}},

Abstract = {{Although well established myocardial infarcts (MI) are not difficult to
   identify in routine hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, recent MI
   may present diagnostic problems. Fibrinogen is a useful marker for
   detecting early ischemic cell damage. Using immunofluorescence on frozen
   tissue, albumin, IgG and fibrinogen have been found throughout the
   sarcoplasm of ischemic fibers in human hearts. In this report,
   monoclonal antibodies to all three proteins were reacted using-the
   avidin-biotin technique in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections
   from autopsy cases of sudden or intraoperative deaths with either subtle
   or no definite ischemic changes evident in routine sections. Strong
   staining of fibrinogen in the fibers associated with coagulative
   necrosis, contraction bands or wavy fibers, and in the fibers presumably
   associated with acute ischemia. Albumin and IgG staining was
   nonspecific. Fibrinogen is a reliable and reproducible marker for
   recognizing early ischemia. This method can be used to diagnose early
   sudden ischemic and intraoperative deaths due to coronary artery bypass
   graft and prosthesis-related complications and may be particularly
   useful for forensic autopsies.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that the major products in the pyrolysis of cellulose can
   not be detected by gas chromatography because of their low volatility.
   Hence it has been difficult to analyze a slight amount of cotton
   composed of cellulose by pyrolysis-gas chromatography (PyGC).
   In our study, acid-catalyzed pyrolysis was applied to forensic
   discrimination of cotton and its blended yarn by PyGC. Fibers were
   pyrolyzed using a Curie-point pyrolyzer, attached to gas chromatograph
   or gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer under the conditions by the
   addition of hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid. The presence of acid
   during pyrolysis provided an increase of volatile products such as
   furfural, and elevated detection limit of the fibers by PyGC in
   comparison with the conventional methods. When 10\% of hydrochloric acid
   or 20\% of phosphoric acid was added, more furfural was detected.
   This method made it possible to analyze a slight amount of cotton and
   its blended yarn by PyGC.}},

   In this study, the relationship between the distance from the root end
   of hair and -SO3- content at the point was determined. The observed
   damage patterns indicated that the degree of oxidative hair damage

Abstract = {{The terms fibrinoid degeneration and fibrinoid substance were first
   introduced by Neumann in 1880 to describe some alterations in the
   staining characteristics of collagen. Collagen fibres which have
   undergone this change are eosinophilic, homogeneous and take some of the
   tinctorial properties of fibrin.
   Lendrum et al. (1962) developed Martius-Scarlet-Blue (MSB) stain, which
   is preferentially taken up by fibrin. The principle of the method
   described by Lendrum and his colleagues is the use of acid dyes of
   different molecular size (Martius yellow, Brilliant Crystal Scarlet 6R,
   methyl blue) in accordance with the alteration in structure of fibrin at
   different stages of development. The newest fibrin likely to be found in
   sections is presumably the fine network of postmortem fibrin. Much of
   this takes a yellow stain with the MSB method, as do erythrocytes.
   Slightly older fibrin (16 hours) takes a bright red stain with the MSB.
   Complete validity of the method depends on prolonged fixation in
   formal-sublimate. It gives brilliant staining with acid dyes and
   enhances metachromasia.
   In the Department of Forensic Medicine in Leeds it was noticed that an
   alteration in collagen staining with MSB stain was taking place in
   samples collected from different kinds of injuries, e.g. ligature marks,
   electrical injuries and burns. Similar changes were only occasionally
   seen in abrasions. It was therefore decided to inflict different kinds
   of injuries on the skins of rats and to fresh pieces of human skin in
   vitro, to observe any alterations in collagen staining with MSB and to
   assess the significance of these changes in relation to the timing of
   injuries. The experimental findings are presented, along with discussion
   and a review of the literature.}},

   constituents that eluted, with noticeable interactions, only on polar

   (TMS) by silylating reagents. The methyl and methyl-TMS derivatives are
   analyzed by high resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) and by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The identification of the
   compounds shows their nature of cannabinoid acids, which the main by
   quantitative point of view results the cannabidiolic acid (CBDA). It is

   This paper examines the modelling aspects of evaluating the evidential

   Modelling the distribution of colour within a particular garment is
   discussed in detail. In addition, a large database allows an empirical
   prior distribution to be incorporated, utilizing kernel density
