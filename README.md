Science is intended to be a cumulative endeavour which is why surveying the literature is essential for any research study so new science can be built on existing knowledge. The large volume of information available within citation databases has become a challenge to manage and distil in all areas of research. This has encouraged the use of a scientometric approach applied to the available literature which is gaining interest in forensic science.

Reference lists from citation databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and references available in the INTERPOL reports for the Fibre (from textile) as evidence type in forensic science are processed and compared.

The source code and the reference lists for individual analysis; to recreate the figures shown in the paper are available in this folder.
